To hack on the GStreamer website, here's what to do:

1) Check out the www module
2) src/autogen.sh
3) create src/entities by symlinking the applicable entities file
   (entities.site.xxx found in htdocs)
	* entities.site.gnl is for building/running the site locally
	* entities.site.fdo is for gstreamer freedesktop setup
   (e.g.: cd src/htdocs; ln -s ./entities.site.fdo ./entities.site; cd ../..)
4) mkdir data
5) bin/data-get (this is not needed if you just plan on updating the generated
   content; note that bin/data-get will download no less than 2-3GB of data)
6) make

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:

Things that are in the data subdirectory and synched with the contents
on the website server by the data-get and data-put scripts. The
things in there are updated by various scripts or by hand.

The data/doc/gstreamer/head/ directory contains subdirs for the CVS version of
the various documentation modules. These should be updated by running 
'make upload' within the docs/ subdirectory of a CVS checkout of each module.

The new-release script updates the data/doc/gstreamer/$VERSION/ copies
automatically, so use that.
