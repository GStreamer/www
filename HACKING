To hack on the GStreamer website, here's what to do:

1) Check out the www module
2) src/autogen.sh
3) create src/entities by symlinking the applicable entities file
	(normally entities.site found in htdocs)
	* entities.site.gnl is for building/running the site locally
	* entities.site.fdo is for gstreamer freedesktop setup
4) mkdir data
4) bin/data-get (this is not needed if you just plan on updating the generated content)
5) make
