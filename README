README for the GStreamer website

RAW MATERIALS
-------------
The website content is split in two parts:
- data contains the big chunks of data that aren't in CVS and should be
  managed through rsync
- src contains the XML source for the website content, which is transformed
  using xsl stylesheets and xsltproc, and managed from CVS
