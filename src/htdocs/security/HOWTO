How to enter a new security alert

1) Choose a new Security Advisory Id
   Format should be YYYY-nnnn, with nnnn incrementing from 001 and 0 padded to 4 digits.
   YYYY is the year.
2) Copy the alert-template.xml to a new filename
   matching the SA id - e.g sa-2016-0001.xml
3) Edit the sa-????.xml file and fill out the details
4) Edit Makefile.am, add the new xml file to the ALERTS= entry
5) Edit alerts.xml and add a new xi:include line for the new sa-????.xml file.

Filling out the advisory XML:

* Fill out the various fields. Some details below, but generally copy
  previous entries.
* If needed, the summary, affected-versions,
  details, impact,  mitigation, workarounds, solution and reference entries
  can hold arbitrary HTML.
* The date should be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
* summary should be a 1 line summary of the issue, and will appear in the list
  on the index page
* affected-versions should provide information about which gstreamer module and
  version(s) contain the vulnerability.
* details is a multiline more detailed summary of the type of vulnerability
* impact should provide information about possible impacts - a leak, crash,
  code execution, information exposure, etc
* mitigation - factors which might reduce the severity or exposure to an exploit,
  such as default settings, address randomisation, or lack of default installation
  of the plugin.
* workarounds should describe any configuration change which might limit exposure
  to the vulnerability
* solution describes which release(s) of which module(s) removes the vulnerability.
* references is a list of <reference> nodes with a title and content that should
  provide links to relevant resources - e.g.
  <reference> <title> CVE Database Entry </title>
     <content> <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9445">CVE-2016-9445</a> </content>
  </reference>
