  <title>GStreamer: Applications</title>
  <body>

<p>
 Because GStreamer is designed to be as generic as possible, a wide 
 range of applications can be build on top of it with very little effort, 
 allowing the programmer to focus on the user interface and human interaction
 components of application design.
</p>

<!--
<h1>Applications using GStreamer</h1>

<p>
 We've started a <a href="../status/?category=2">status page</a> that tracks the 
 progress of applications that written using GStreamer. There are some really nice applications out there using Gstreamer now so be sure to check it out. And of course, let us know if you have anything you'd like to add to it.
</p>

<h1>Our GStreamer applications</h1>

<h2>GStreamer Player</h2>
<p>
One well-featured example shipped with GStreamer is the 
<a href="&site;/modules/gst-player.html">GStreamer Player</a>,
a simple, but functional, media player that
 supports any media type for which plugins exist. 
</p>

<h2>GStreamer Editor</h2>
<p>
 We also include a graphical pipeline contruction interface similar in
 goals to GLAME called 
<a href="&site;/modules/gst-editor.html">GStreamer Editor</a>.
 It was recently rewritten from the ground up and ported to GTK+ 2.
</p>

<h2>GStreamer Recorder</h2>
<p>
Our third in-house project is
<a href="&site;/modules/gst-recorder.html">GStreamer Recorder</a>,
which is currently under
development and will be able to record perfectly synchronized audio/video
in any format supported by GStreamer. 
</p>


<h2>Video-Whale</h2>
<p><a href="videowhale.html">Video-Whale</a> is an implementation of a Gstreamer-based video-wall. Making a video wall with GStreamer is easy, this article with pictures from Zeeshan Ali shows you how.
</p>

<h1>Application ideas</h1>
<p>
Just about anything you can think to do with media is possible with
GStreamer.
You can <A href="ideas.html">see some of our ideas for applications</A>.
If you're not sure if your idea would work, just hop on the <A
HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gstreamer-devel">gstreamer-devel</A>
mailing list and ask us, we'll be glad to discuss it with you!</p>
