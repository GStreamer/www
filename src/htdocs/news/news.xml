    <content><p>As of 9:10pm PST Oct 31, 1999, GStreamer has officially become a public
project.  I've released 0.0.9, in it's current somewhat sorry state, to
get it out to anyone who wants to look around.  A 0.1.0 release is planned
in the near future (a couple weeks away, maybe) with a lot more of the
plugins actually working, but for now it's still pretty cool.</p>

<p><tt>&lt;drumroll&gt;</tt>And here it
is...<tt>&lt;/drumroll&gt;</tt>: <tt><A href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gstreamer/gstreamer-0.0.9.tar.gz">gstreamer-0.0.9.tar.gz</A></tt>

    <content><A href="http://effectv.sourceforge.net/">EffecTV</A> is a cool project which allows you to add real-time effects to a video stream captured from a v4l-device.  Combining this with GStreamer allows you to use any effecTV plugin in any pipeline.  This can easily let you do really nice things.  Here's an example.
<p>
Starting from <A href="&site;/media/medium/alien.mpg">Alien Song</A>, we first run the pipeline
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="&site;/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/>{ queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! agingTV ! colorspace ! <BR/> mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-age.mpg }</PRE> to re-encode the movie with the agingTV effect.  This is the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-age.mpg">result</A>.
</p><p>
Next, we re-encode the same video using the edgeTV plug-in :
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="&site;/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/>{ queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! edgeTV ! colorspace ! <BR/> mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-edge.mpg }</PRE>
This is the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-edge.mpg">result.</A>
</p><p>Finally, we add the effects; we create an aged version of the edgy version.  This is where GStreamer really shines; in effectv you have to use loopback v4l devices.
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="&site;/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/> { queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! edgeTV ! <BR/> agingTV ! colorspace ! mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-edge-age.mpg }</PRE>
And here's the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-edge-age.mpg">result.</A>
</p><p>
We hope to work with the effecTV authors to provide a convenient library which will allow easy access to these great effects.
</p><p>
The effecTV plug-ins : soon coming to a gst-enabled video editor near you !
</p><p>
<I>sample created movies lack sound and encoding has been ctrl-c'd at random moments because I'm lazy.  Colorspace is necessary because the effecTV plugins work in the RGB colorspace and MPEG video works in the YUV colorspace.  The effecTV have just been added to CVS code and will be in the next stable GStreamer release.
</I>
Here's screenshots of three different effects applied on the alien-song movie:
</p><p>

    <title>gst-player officially unmaintained and deprecated</title>
    <content>
<p>
gst-player has been part of GStreamer almost from day one, but only been
maintained at irregular intervals. Currently it is quite broken in many cases
and we have due to this decided to officially remove it from the project as
today there are better alternatives. This means all references to the player
have been removed and the bugzilla entry will also be removed. If you are
looking for a GTK+-based video player using GStreamer we recommend <a

    <title>GStreamer licensing advisory online</title>
    <content>
<p>
GStreamer is a project which aims to fullfill an important part of the
infrastructure for free and open source operating systems. As a result of this
we need to make sure everything we do is licensed in a way that enables us to
fullfill this role well. To help ensure this we have, after a lot of discussion
and gathering of external feedback, put together <a
href="&site;/documentation/licensing.html">this
licensing advisory</a>. It explains both how plugins for GStreamer will have to
be licensed for us to approve them for inclusion and suggestions for how free
software developers should license their software to solve the practical
problems facing us today. We strongly advise everyone to read this. The content
of this advisory is also included in our FAQ.  </p>

instead.

    <title>GStreamer on Symbian OS</title>
    <content>
      <p>
        GStreamer is now ported on Symbian platform. The GStreamer core version ported is v0.10.19.
        It works with the S60 SDK versions  3.2 and 5.0. It has been tested with the Nokia 5800
        XpressMusic and N78 phone models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial package contains:
        <ul>
          <li>gstreamer core</li>
          <li>gst-plugins-base</li>
          <li>audio source and sink elements for symbian</li>
          <li>some gst-good-plugins</li>
          <li>Test application</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next steps are to integrate the changes step by step with the official
        source tree.

<content>
<p>
The GStreamer team announces a new release of the GStreamer core and
gst-plugins-base modules for the 0.10 GStreamer stable release series.
</p>
<p>
This is an ad-hoc bug-fix release that fixes a thread-safety issue with the
widely-used multiqueue element, and a corner case timestamping issue in
basesrc. It is identical to the 0.10.33 release otherwise. gst-plugins-base
0.10.34 is fully identical to 0.10.33 and was just made to keep core/base
version numbers in sync.

        <title>GStreamer 1.0 released</title>
        <content>
        <p>
The GStreamer project is pleased to announce the very first release of
the new API and ABI-stable 1.x series of the GStreamer multimedia
framework.
        </p>
        <p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.
        </p>
        <p>
Major improvements include:
        <ul>
<li>more flexible memory handling</li>
<li>extensible and negotiable metadata for buffers</li>
<li>caps negotiation and renegotiation mechanisms, decoupled from buffer allocation</li>
<li>improved caps renegotiation</li>
<li>automatic re-sending of state for dynamic pipelines</li>
<li>reworked and more fine-grained pad probing</li>
<li>simpler and more descriptive audio and video caps</li>
<li>more efficient allocation of buffers, events and other mini objects</li>
<li>improved timestamp handling</li>
<li>support for gobject-inspection-based language bindings</li>
<li>countless other improvements</li>
        </ul>
An overview of the architectural changes can be found in
<a href="http://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/keynote-gstreamer-10/">Wim Tayman's GStreamer 1.0 keynote</a>
from the GStreamer Conference 2012 in San Diego (click on the 'Share' tab for other video formats).
        </p>
        <p>
Most of these changes involve the GStreamer plugin API. The application
API has changed comparatively little, and most applications should be
fairly easy to port to the new API. There is a
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/tree/docs/random/porting-to-1.0.txt">porting guide</a>
available.
        </p>
        <p>
The GStreamer team would like to thank everyone who helped bring this
release about, whether by submitting patches, reporting bugs, testing,
sponsoring development, attending hackfests, or simply supplying moral
support.
        </p>
        <p>
This is the end of a long development process, but also the beginning of
one. This release does not mark the pinnacle of perfection, but the
point where the team is content with the API and stability and quality
of the code base in general, especially compared to the old 0.10 series.
        </p>
        <p>
There will be bugs to fix, and starting from this release there will be
distinct bug-fixing and feature development cycles, with the goal of
getting bug-fixes out quicker and unencumbered by other more risky
changes. See the
<a href="&site;/wiki/ReleasePlanning/RoadMap">ReleasePlanning/RoadMap page on the wiki</a>
for a tentative road map and possible schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
Please also note that we may still need to fine-tune some minor aspects
of plugin behaviour in the next development cycle (e.g. bufferpool
draining on renegotiation), so keep an eye out for that when porting
elements over.
        </p>

        <title>GStreamer 0.10 no longer maintained</title>
        <content>
        <p>
Since this has never been announced officially outside of the conference
circuit, the GStreamer team would like to
<a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/gstreamer-announce/2013-March/000273.html">clarify</a>
that GStreamer 0.10 is no longer maintained. Not by us, nor by anyone else.
There will be no more GStreamer 0.10 releases, not even bug-fix releases.
Bugs will not be investigated unless they also apply to GStreamer 1.x.
Patches will only be reviewed and pushed if they apply to one of the
current 1.x branches or fix an issue that still pertains to 1.x.
Bug fixes have not been backported systematically to 0.10 for a very long
time now, and there are many hundreds of bugs that have only been fixed
in 1.x, and manymore are fixed every week. Any commits to the 0.10 branch
are made purely on an ad-hoc basis now, and we may lock down the branch
completely. No more features will be added to 0.10. However, GStreamer 0.10
support is of course still available on a commercial basis from the usual
suspects.
        </p>
        <p>
We realise and regret that this may cause some inconvenience, and we
also understand that there are circumstances where there are valid
reasons not to migrate to 1.0 at this time, or in some cases ever, but
we would also like to dispel any doubt whatsoever that there is any
other way. We have neither the resources, nor the will or the energy to
maintain more than one major version. We must use the little resources
we have on code that has a future.
        </p>
        <p>
We are happy to provide help and advice to anyone migrating to 1.0. If
there are plugins that haven't been ported yet that you need, let us
know, maybe we can help get them ported.
        </p>
        <p>
Thanks for your understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
Happy hacking, see you on the other side!

        <title>GStreamer Core, Plugins and RTSP server 1.3.90 release candidate</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
the stable 1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features
on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided together with this
release.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4 release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x, 1.2.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.2.x it contains some
new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too risky as a
bugfix.

        <title>GStreamer Core, Plugins and RTSP server 1.4.1 stable release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a bugfix release of the stable
1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features on top
of the 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework that contains new features.
The 1.4.x bugfix releases only contain important bugfixes compared to 1.4.0.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided by the
GStreamer project for this release.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4.x release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.0.x it contains
some new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too
risky as a bugfix.

        <title>gst-editing-services, gst-python and gnonlin  1.3.90 release candidate</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
the stable 1.4 release series of gst-editing-services, gst-python and gnonlin.
The 1.4 release series is adding new features
on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4 release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x, 1.2.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.2.x it contains some
new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too risky as a
bugfix.

        <title>GStreamer Core, Plugins and RTSP server 1.4.3 stable release</title>
        <content>
<p>
Note that this announcement includes everything from 1.4.2 too, which was
never officially released as some critical bugs were found.
</p>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a bugfix release of the stable
1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features on top
of the 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework that contains new features.
The 1.4.x bugfix releases only contain important bugfixes compared to 1.4.0.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided by the
GStreamer project for this release.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4.x release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.0.x it contains
some new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too
risky as a bugfix.

        <title>GStreamer VAAPI is now part of upstream GStreamer</title>
        <content>

        <p>
The GStreamer-VAAPI module which provides support for hardware-accelerated
video decoding, encoding and post-processing on Intel (and other) graphics hardware
on Linux has moved from its previous home at the Intel Open Source Technology Center (01.org)
to the upstream GStreamer repositories, where it will in future be maintained
as part of the upstream GStreamer project and released in lockstep with the
other GStreamer modules.
        </p>
        <p>
The current maintainers will continue to spearhead the development at the new location:
        <br/>
        <br/>
<a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-vaapi/">https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-vaapi/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
GStreamer-VAAPI relies heavily on certain GStreamer infrastructure API that
is still in flux such as the OpenGL integration API or the codec parser
libraries, and one of the goals of the move was to be able to leverage
new developments early and provide tighter integration with the latest
developments of those APIs and other graphics-related APIs provided by
GStreamer, which should hopefully improve performance even further and in
some cases might also provide better stability.
        </p>
        <p>
Thanks to everyone involved in making this move happen!
        </p>
        <p>
<i>New Versioning scheme and Supported GStreamer Versions</i>
        </p>
        <p>
The version numbering has been changed to match the GStreamer version
numbering to avoid confusion: there is a new gstreamer-vaapi 1.6.0 release
and a 1.6 branch that is roughly equivalent to the previous 0.7.0 version.
Future releases 1.7.x and 1.8.x will be made alongside GStreamer releases.
        </p>
        <p>
Whilst it was possible and supported by previous releases to build against
a whole range of different GStreamer versions (such as 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 or 1.7/1.8),
in future there will only be one target branch, so that git master will
track GStreamer git master, 1.8.x will target GStreamer 1.8, and
1.6.x is targetting the 1.6 series.
        </p>
        <p>
<i>Miscellaneous Changes</i>
        </p>
        <p>
All GStreamer-VAAPI functionality is now provided solely by its GStreamer
elements. There is no more public library exposing GstVaapi API, this API
was only ever meant for private use by the elements. Parts of it may be
resurrected again in future if needed, but for now it has all been made
private.
        </p>
        <p>
GStreamer-VAAPI now unconditionally uses the codecparser library in
gst-plugins-bad instead of shipping its own internal copy. Similarly,
it no longer ships its own codec parsers but relies on the upstream
codec parser elements.
        </p>
        <p>
The GStreamer-VAAPI encoder elements have been renamed from vaapiencode_foo
to vaapifooenc, so encoders are now called vaapih264enc, vaapih265enc,
vaapimpeg2enc, vaapijpegenc, and vaapivp8enc.
        </p>
        <p>
<i>Bug Tracking</i>
        </p>
        <p>
Bugs had already been tracked on <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.og">GNOME bugzilla</a>
but will be moved from the gstreamer-vaapi product into a new gstreamer-vaapi
component of the GStreamer product in bugzilla. Please file new bugs against
the new component in the GStreamer product from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
<i>Pending Patches</i>
        </p>
        <p>
The code base has been re-indented to the GStreamer code style, which
affected some files more than others. This means that some of the patches
in bugzilla might not apply any longer, so if you have any unmerged patches
sitting in bugzilla please consider checking if they still apply cleany and
refresh them if not. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
        </p>

        <title>Orc 0.4.25 bug-fix release</title>
        <content>
        <p>
The GStreamer team announces another maintenance bug-fix release of liborc,
the Optimized Inner Loop Runtime Compiler. Main changes since the previous
release:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>compiler: also prefer the backup function when no target,
                instead of trying to use emulation which is usually slower</li>
            <li>executor: fix load of parameters smaller than 64 bits, fixing
                crashes on ldresnearb and friends in emulated code</li>
            <li>Only check for Android's liblog on Android targets, so we don't
                accidentally pick up another liblog that may exist elsewhere</li>
            <li>Make -Bsymbolic check in configure work with clang</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <title>Revamped documentation and gstreamer.com switch-off</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer project is pleased to announce its new revamped
<a href="&site;/documentation/">documentation</a> featuring a new design,
a new navigation bar, search functionality, source code syntax highlighting
as well as new tutorials and documentation about how to use GStreamer on
Android, iOS, macOS and Windows.
</p><p>
It now contains the former gstreamer.com SDK tutorials which have kindly been
made available by Fluendo &amp; Collabora under a Creative Commons license. The
tutorials have been reviewed and updated for GStreamer 1.x. The old
gstreamer.com site will be shut down with redirects pointing to the updated
tutorials and the official GStreamer website.
</p><p>
Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.
</p><p>
This is just the beginning. Our goal is to provide a more cohesive
documentation experience for our users going forward. To that end, we have
converted most of our documentation into markdown format. This should hopefully
make it easier for developers and contributors to create new documentation, and
to maintain the existing one. There is a lot more work to do, do get in touch
if you want to help out. The documentation is maintained in the new
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-docs">gst-docs</a> module.
</p><p>
If you encounter any problems or spot any omissions or outdated content in the
new documentation, please <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GStreamer&amp;component=documentation">
file a bug in bugzilla</a> to let us know.

The GStreamer Conference is a conference for developers, community
members, decision-makers, industry partners, and anyone else interested
in the GStreamer multimedia framework and open source multimedia.

we'd like to hear from you!
        </p>
        <p>
We also plan on having another session with short lightning talks /
demos / showcase talks for those who just want to show what they've
been working on or do a mini-talk instead of a full-length talk.
        </p>
        <p>

        <title>GStreamer 1.13.1 unstable development release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first development release in
the unstable 1.13 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.13 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.12 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.13 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.14 series which is scheduled for release in a
few weeks time. Any newly-added API can still change until that point, although
it is rare for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
<p>
Packagers: please note that quite a few plugins and libraries have moved
between modules, so please take extra care and make sure inter-module
version dependencies are such that users can only upgrade all modules in
one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.13 and 1.12 on their system.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided shortly.

        <title>GStreamer Conference 2018 Announced</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer project is happy to announce that this year's GStreamer
Conference will take place on Thursday-Friday 25-26 October 2018 in
Edinburgh, Scotland.
</p>
<p>
You can find more details about the conference on the
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/2018/">GStreamer
Conference 2018 web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
A call for papers will be sent out shortly. Registration will open at a
later time. We will announce those and any further updates on the
<a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/gstreamer-announce">gstreamer-announce mailing list</a>,
the <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/news/">website</a>,
and <a href="https://twitter.com/GStreamer">on Twitter</a>.
</p>
<p>
Talk slots will be available in varying durations from 20 minutes up to
45 minutes. Whatever you're doing or planning to do with GStreamer,
we'd like to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
We also plan to have sessions with short lightning talks / demos /
showcase talks for those who just want to show what they've been
working on or do a mini-talk instead of a full-length talk. Lightning
talk slots will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis, so make
sure to reserve your slot if you plan on giving a lightning talk.
</p>
<p>
There will also be a social event again on Thursday evening.
</p>
<p>
There are also plans to have a hackfest the weekend right after the conference.
</p>
<p>
We hope to see you in Edinburgh!

        <title>GStreamer 1.15.1 unstable development release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first development release in
the unstable 1.15 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.15 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.16 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.15 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.16 series which is scheduled for release in a
few weeks time. Any newly-added API can still change until that point, although
it is rare for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
<p>
Packagers: please note that quite a few plugins and libraries have moved
between modules, so please take extra care and make sure inter-module
version dependencies are such that users can only upgrade all modules in
one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.15 and 1.14 on their system.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided shortly.
</p>

        <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.13.0 release</title>
        <content>
<p>
  A new version of the GStreamer Rust bindings, 0.13.0, was released.
</p>
<p>
  This new release is the first to include direct support for
  implementing GStreamer elements and other types in Rust. Previously
  this was provided via a different crate.<br/>
  In addition to this, the new release features many API improvements,
  cleanups, newly added bindings and bugfixes.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2019/02/21/new-release.html">gtk-rs</a>
  release, and a new version of GStreamer plugins written in Rust was also released.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/blob/490004d9c55d06a3b545ebc15c13a80893937bb9/gstreamer/CHANGELOG.md#0130-2019-02-22">gstreamer-rs</a>
  and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs-sys/blob/e274b5495bb1698cd9fe48de40ab5f9f2b0e1faa/gstreamer-sys/CHANGELOG.md#070-2019-02-22">gstreamer-rs-sys</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code and documentation for the bindings is available on the freedesktop.org GitLab
    <ul>

  for peer-to-peer communication based on SCTP, BUNDLE support, as well as
  support for multiple TURN servers.</li>

  <li>AV1 video codec support for Matroska and QuickTime/MP4 containers and more
  configuration options and supported input formats for the AOMedia AV1 encoder</li>

  <li>Support for Closed Captions and other Ancillary Data in video</li>

  <li>Support for planar (non-interleaved) raw audio</li>

  <li><tt>GstVideoAggregator</tt>, <tt>compositor</tt> and
      OpenGL mixer elements are now in -base</li>

  <li>WebM and Matroska ContentEncryption support in the Matroska demuxer</li>

  <li>new WebKit WPE-based web browser source element</li>

  <li>Video4Linux: HEVC encoding and decoding, JPEG encoding, and improved dmabuf import/export</li>

  <li>Hardware-accelerated Nvidia video decoder gained support for VP8/VP9 decoding,
  whilst the encoder gained support for H.265/HEVC encoding.</li>

  <li>Many improvements to the Intel Media SDK based hardware-accelerated video
  decoder and encoder plugin (msdk): dmabuf import/export for zero-copy
  integration with other components; VP9 decoding; 10-bit HEVC encoding; video
  post-processing (vpp) support including deinterlacing; and the video decoder
  now handles dynamic resolution changes.</li>

  <li>The ASS/SSA subtitle overlay renderer can now handle multiple subtitles
  that overlap in time and will show them on screen simultaneously</li>

showcase talks for those who just want to show what they've been
working on or do a mini-talk instead of a full-length talk. Lightning
talk slots will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis, so make
sure to reserve your slot if you plan on giving a lightning talk.
</p>
<p>
There will also be a social event again on Thursday evening.
</p>
<p>
There are also plans to have a hackfest the weekend right after the conference
on 2-3 November 2019.
</p>
<p>
We hope to see you in Lyon, and please spread the word!

        <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.14.0 release</title>
        <content>
<p>
  A new version of the GStreamer Rust bindings, 0.14.0, was released.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from updating to GStreamer 1.16, this release is mostly focussed on
  adding more bindings for various APIs and general API cleanup and bugfixes.<br/>
  The most notable API additions in this release are bindings for gst::Memory and
  gst::Allocator as well as bindings for gst_base::BaseParse and gst_video::VideoDecoder
  and VideoEncoder. The latter also come with support for implementing subclasses and
  the gst-plugins-rs module contains an video decoder and parser (for CDG), and a
  video encoder (for AV1) based on this.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2019/06/22/new-release.html">gtk-rs</a>
  release, and a new version of the GStreamer plugins written in Rust was also released.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/blob/28a24a4fc06b45a713f159d17cd4e8526ae3eae2/gstreamer-sdp/CHANGELOG.md#0140-2019-06-24">gstreamer-rs</a>
  and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs-sys/blob/3dc291d51abf1401622382b7e51a80424cd0f86e/gstreamer-sys/CHANGELOG.md#080-2019-06-24">gstreamer-rs-sys</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code and documentation for the bindings is available on the freedesktop.org GitLab
    <ul>

        <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.15.0 release</title>
        <content>
<p>
  A new version of the GStreamer Rust bindings, 0.15.0, was released.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2019/12/15/new-release.html">gtk-rs</a>
  release, and a new version of the GStreamer plugins written in Rust was also released.
</p>
<p>
  This new version features a lot of newly bound API for creating subclasses
  of various GStreamer types: GstPreset, GstTagSetter, GstClock,
  GstSystemClock, GstAudioSink, GstAudioSrc, GstDevice, GstDeviceProvider,
  GstAudioDecoder and GstAudioEncoder.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to that, a lot of bugfixes and further API improvements have
  happened over the last few months that should make development of
  GStreamer applications or plugins in Rust as convenient as possible.
</p>
<p>
  A new release of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs">GStreamer Rust plugins</a> will follow in the next days.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/blob/d26ffc2c219ca821aefbc9eababcc7ceb11ec83f/gstreamer/CHANGELOG.md#0150-2019-12-18">gstreamer-rs</a>
  and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs-sys/blob/0002f2e5310960c564398f7e31e3ee02f7383b0c/gstreamer-sys/CHANGELOG.md#081-2019-12-16">gstreamer-rs-sys</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code and documentation for the bindings is available on the freedesktop.org GitLab
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer Rust Bindings</a> (<a href="https://slomo.pages.freedesktop.org/rustdocs/gstreamer/gstreamer/">documentation</a>)</li>

        <title>GStreamer 1.17.1 unstable development release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first development release in
the unstable 1.17 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.17 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.16 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.17 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.18 series which is scheduled for release in a
few weeks time. Any newly-added API can still change until that point, although
it is rare for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
<p>
The autotools build has been dropped entirely for this release, so it's
finally all Meson from here on.
</p>
<p>
This development release is primarily for distributors and early
adaptors and anyone who still needs to update their build/packaging
setup for Meson.
</p>
<p>
On the documentation front we have switched away from gtk-doc to
hotdoc, but we now provide a release tarball of the built documentation
in html and devhelp format, and we recommend distributors switch to
that and provide a single gstreamer documentation package in future.
</p>
<p>
Instead of a gst-validate tarball we now ship a gst-devtools tarball, and
the gstreamer-editing-services tarball has been renamed to gst-editing-services
for consistency with the module name in Gitlab.
</p>
<p>
Packagers: please note that plugins may have moved between modules, so please
take extra care and make sure inter-module version dependencies are such that
users can only upgrade all modules in one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.17
and 1.16 on their system.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are also available at the
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/">usual location</a>.

        <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.16.0 release</title>
        <content>
<p>
  A new version of the GStreamer Rust bindings, 0.16.0, was released.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2020/07/04/new-release.html">gtk-rs</a>
  release.
</p>
<p>
  This is the first version that includes optional support for new GStreamer
  1.18 APIs. As GStreamer 1.18 was not released yet, these new APIs might
  still change. The minimum supported version of the bindings is still
  GStreamer 1.8 and the targetted GStreamer API version can be selected by
  applications via feature flags.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from this, new version features mostly features API cleanup and the
  addition of a
  few missing APIs. The focus of this release was to make usage of GStreamer
  from Rust as convenient and complete as possible.
</p>
<p>
  The new release also brings a lot of bugfixes, most of which were
  already part of the 0.15.x bugfix releases.
</p>
<p>
  A new release of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs">GStreamer Rust plugins</a> will follow in the next days.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/blob/f40821ba662e6ba29ddb72915ea30ee4191da3ea/gstreamer/CHANGELOG.md#0160-2020-07-06">gstreamer-rs</a>

        <title>GStreamer 1.17.90 pre-release (1.18 rc1)</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate
for the upcoming stable 1.18 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.17 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.16 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The 1.17.90 pre-release series is for testing and development purposes
in the lead-up to the stable 1.18 series which is now feature frozen
and scheduled for release soon. Any newly-added API can still change
until that point, although it is very rare for that to happen at this point.
</p>
<p>
Depending on how things go there might be another release candidate
next week and then hopefully 1.18.0 shortly after.
</p>
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
<p>
The autotools build has been dropped entirely for this release, so it's
finally all Meson from here on.
</p>
<p>
This pre-release is for all developers, distributors and early
adaptors and anyone who still needs to update their build/packaging
setup for Meson.
</p>
<p>
On the documentation front we have switched away from gtk-doc to
hotdoc, but we now provide a release tarball of the built documentation
in html and devhelp format, and we recommend distributors switch to
that and provide a single gstreamer documentation package in future.

        <title>GStreamer 1.19.1 unstable development release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first development release in
the unstable 1.19 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.19 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.18 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.19 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.20 series which is scheduled for release in a
few weeks time. Any newly-added API can still change until that point, although
it is rare for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
<p>
This development release is primarily for distributors and early
adaptors and anyone who still needs to update their build/packaging
setup for Meson.
</p>
<p>
Packagers: please note that plugins may have moved between modules, so please
take extra care and make sure inter-module version dependencies are such that
users can only upgrade all modules in one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.19
and 1.18 on their system.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are also available at the
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/">usual location</a>.

    <title>IRC Channel has moved from Freenode to OFTC</title>
    <content>
      <p>
        Due to the widely reported issues at the Freenode IRC network, the
        official GStreamer discussion IRC channel has moved to #gstreamer on
        the OFTC IRC network alongside other Freedesktop projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can connect to it with your existing <a href="irc://irc.oftc.net/gstreamer">IRC client</a>,
        or using <a href="https://matrix.to/#_oftc_%23gstreamer:matrix.org">Matrix</a> which
        has a browser client and native apps for all platforms.

        <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.17.0 release</title>
        <content>
<p>
  A new version of the GStreamer Rust bindings, 0.17.0, was released.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2021/06/22/new-release.html">gtk-rs</a>
  release.
</p>
<p>
  This is the first version that includes optional support for new GStreamer
  1.20 APIs. As GStreamer 1.20 was not released yet, these new APIs might
  still change. The minimum supported version of the bindings is still
  GStreamer 1.8 and the targetted GStreamer API version can be selected by
  applications via feature flags.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from this, the new version features a lot of API cleanup, especially
  of the subclassing APIs, and the addition of a few missing bindings. As
  usual, the focus of this release was to make usage of GStreamer from Rust as
  convenient and complete as possible.
</p>
<p>
  The new release also brings a lot of bugfixes, most of which were
  already part of the 0.16.x bugfix releases.
</p>
<p>
  A new release of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs">GStreamer Rust plugins</a> will follow in the next days.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/blob/0.17.0/gstreamer/CHANGELOG.md#0170-2021-06-28">gstreamer-rs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code and documentation for the bindings is available on the freedesktop.org GitLab
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer Rust Bindings</a> (<a href="https://gstreamer.pages.freedesktop.org/gstreamer-rs/stable/0.16/docs/">documentation</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  as well as on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>.

        <title>GStreamer 1.19.2 unstable development release and git monorepo transition</title>
        <content>
<p>
<b>GStreamer 1.19.2 unstable development release</b>
</p>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second development release in
the unstable 1.19 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.19 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.18 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.19 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.20 series which is scheduled for release in a
few weeks time. Any newly-added API can still change until that point, although
it is rare for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
<p>
This development release is primarily for distributors and early
adaptors and anyone who still needs to update their build/packaging
setup for Meson.
</p>
<p>
Packagers: please note that plugins may have moved between modules, so please
take extra care and make sure inter-module version dependencies are such that
users can only upgrade all modules in one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.19
and 1.18 on their system. Also, gst-plugins-good 1.19.2 depends on 1.19.2
gst-plugins-base (even if the meson dependency check claims otherwise).
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will also be available shortly at the
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/">usual location</a>.

</p>
<p>
<b>Git monorepo transition</b>
</p>
<p>
Following the 1.19.2 release all git <tt>master</tt> branches in git are now
frozen and will stay frozen. as we embark on some infrastructure
plumbing that will see many of our git modules merged into a mono
repository, which should massively streamline and improve our developer
experience.
</p>
<p>
Expect a few days of disruptions, but we'll do our best to get the show
back on the road as quickly as possible!
</p>
<p>
We'll let you know when it's all done and will post more details and
migration instructions once everything's in place.
</p>
<p>
When we emerge on the other side there will be a shiny new <tt>main</tt> branch
in the GStreamer repository and development will continue there.
</p>
<p>
Nothing will happen to the existing stable branches and repositories,
and the existing master branches will also stay in place for the time
being, but will no longer be updated.
</p>
<p>
There will still be separate release tarballs for the various modules.
</p>
<p>
More details soon, stay tuned.

        <title>GStreamer 1.19.90 pre-release (1.20 rc1)</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is excited to announce the first release candidate
for the upcoming stable 1.20 release series.
</p>
<p>
This 1.19.90 pre-release is for testing and development purposes
in the lead-up to the stable 1.20 series which is now feature frozen
and scheduled for release very soon. Any newly-added API can still change
until that point, although it is extremely unlikely for that to happen at
this point.
</p>
<p>
Depending on how things go there might be more release candidates in
the next couple of days, but in any case we're aiming to get 1.20.0 out
as soon as possible.

<p>
Preliminary release notes highlighting all the new features, bugfixes,
performance optimizations and other important changes can be found at
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.20/">https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.20/</a>.

        <title>GStreamer 1.21.1 unstable development release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first development release in
the unstable 1.21 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.21 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.20 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.21 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.22 series which is scheduled for release in
December 2022. Any newly-added API can still change until that point.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Full release notes will be provided in the near future, highlighting all the
new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important changes.
</p>
-->
<p>
This development release is primarily for developers and early adopters.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Packagers: please note that plugins may have moved between modules, so please
take extra care and make sure inter-module version dependencies are such that
users can only upgrade all modules in one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.21
and 1.20 on their system.
</p>
-->
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are also available at the
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/">usual location</a>.

      <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.19 / Rust Plugins 0.9 release</title>
      <content>
<p>
  Version 0.19 of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer Rust bindings</a> was released.
  Together with the bindings, also version 0.9 of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs">GStreamer Rust plugins</a> was released.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2022/10/18/new-release.html">gtk-rs 0.16 release</a> and the corresponding API changes.
</p>
<p>
  This release includes optional support for the latest new GStreamer
  1.22 APIs. As GStreamer 1.22 was not released yet, these new APIs might
  still change. The minimum supported version of the bindings was updated to
  GStreamer 1.14 and the targetted GStreamer API version can be selected by
  applications/plugins via feature flags.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from this, the new version features a lot of API cleanup and
  improvements, and the addition of a few missing bindings. Like in the past,
  the focus of this release was to make usage of GStreamer from Rust as
  convenient and complete as possible.
</p>
<p>
  The new release also brings a lot of bugfixes, most of which were
  already part of the 0.18.x bugfix releases.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/blob/main/gstreamer/CHANGELOG.md#0190-2022-10-22">gstreamer-rs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code and documentation for the bindings is available on the freedesktop.org GitLab
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer Rust Bindings</a> (<a href="https://gstreamer.pages.freedesktop.org/gstreamer-rs/stable/0.19/docs/">documentation</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  as well as on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new 0.9 version of the GStreamer Rust plugins features many improvements to the existing plugins as well as many new plugins.
  The full list of available plugins can be seen in the repository's <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/blob/0.9/README.md">README.md</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you find any bugs, notice any missing features or other issues please
  report them in GitLab for the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/issues/new">bindings</a>
  or the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/issues/new">plugins</a>.

        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a second development release in
the unstable 1.21 release series.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.21 release series adds new features on top of the current
stable 1.20 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series
of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
The unstable 1.21 release series is for testing and development purposes in
the lead-up to the stable 1.22 series which is scheduled for release in
December 2022. Any newly-added API can still change until that point.

This development release is primarily for developers and early adopters.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Packagers: please note that plugins may have moved between modules, so please
take extra care and make sure inter-module version dependencies are such that
users can only upgrade all modules in one go, instead of seeing a mix of 1.21
and 1.20 on their system.

        <title>GStreamer 1.21.90 pre-release (1.22 rc1)</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is excited to announce the first release candidate
for the upcoming stable 1.22 release series.
</p>
<p>
This 1.21.90 pre-release is for testing and development purposes
in the lead-up to the stable 1.22 series which is now feature frozen
and scheduled for release very soon. Any newly-added API can still change
until that point, although it is extremely unlikely for that to happen at
this point.
</p>
<p>
Depending on how things go there might be more release candidates in
the next couple of days, but in any case we're aiming to get 1.22.0 out
as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Preliminary release notes highlighting all the new features, bugfixes,
performance optimizations and other important changes will be made
available in the next few days.

      <title>GStreamer Rust bindings 0.20 / Rust Plugins 0.10 release</title>
      <content>
<p>
  Version 0.20 of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer Rust bindings</a> was released.
  Together with the bindings, also version 0.10 of the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs">GStreamer Rust plugins</a> was released.
</p>
<p>
  As usual this release follows the latest <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2023/02/10/new-release.html">gtk-rs 0.17 release</a> and the corresponding API changes.
</p>
<p>
  This release features relatively few changes and mostly contains the
  addition of some convenience APIs, the addition of bindings for some minor
  APIs and various optimizations.
</p>
<p>
  As part of the optimizations there will be a lot fewer temporary allocations
  with the new version (especially for NUL-terminated strings), and improved
  code generation which does not only improve performance but also reduces the
  size of the resulting binaries considerably. Various GStreamer plugins saw
  size reductions of 15-20%.
</p>
<p>
  The new release also brings a lot of bugfixes, most of which were
  already part of the 0.19.x bugfix releases.
</p>
<p>
  Details can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/blob/main/gstreamer/CHANGELOG.md#0200-2023-02-10">gstreamer-rs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code and documentation for the bindings is available on the freedesktop.org GitLab
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer Rust Bindings</a> (<a href="https://gstreamer.pages.freedesktop.org/gstreamer-rs/stable/0.20/docs/">documentation</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  as well as on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new 0.10 version of the GStreamer Rust plugins features many
  improvements to the existing plugins as well as a few new plugins. A
  majority of the changes were already backported to the 0.9 release series
  and its bugfix releases, which is part of GStreamer 1.22.
</p>
<p>
  A full list of available plugins can be seen in the repository's <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/blob/0.10/README.md">README.md</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Details for this release can be found in the release notes for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0100-2023-02-10">gst-plugins-rs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you find any bugs, notice any missing features or other issues please
  report them in GitLab for the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/issues/new">bindings</a>
  or the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/issues/new">plugins</a>.

        <title>GStreamer Conference 2023 announced to take place 25-26 Sept 2023 in A Coruña, Spain</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer project is thrilled to announce that this year's GStreamer
Conference will take place on Monday-Tuesday 25-26 September 2023
in A Coruña, Spain, followed by a hackfest.
</p>
<p>
You can find more details about the conference on the
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/2023/">GStreamer
Conference 2023 web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
A call for papers will be sent out in due course.
</p>
<p>
Registration will open at a later time, in late June / early July.
</p>
<p>
We will announce those and any further updates on the
<a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/gstreamer-announce">gstreamer-announce mailing list</a>,
the <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/news/">website</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/GStreamer">on Twitter</a>.
and <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@GStreamer">on Mastodon</a>.
</p>
<p>
Talk slots will be available in varying durations from 20 minutes up to
45 minutes. Whatever you're doing or planning to do with GStreamer,
we'd like to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
We also plan to have sessions with short lightning talks / demos /
showcase talks for those who just want to show what they've been
working on or do a mini-talk instead of a full-length talk. Lightning
talk slots will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis, so make
sure to reserve your slot if you plan on giving a lightning talk.
