    <content><p>As of 9:10pm PST Oct 31, 1999, GStreamer has officially become a public
project.  I've released 0.0.9, in it's current somewhat sorry state, to
get it out to anyone who wants to look around.  A 0.1.0 release is planned
in the near future (a couple weeks away, maybe) with a lot more of the
plugins actually working, but for now it's still pretty cool.</p>

<p><tt>&lt;drumroll&gt;</tt>And here it
is...<tt>&lt;/drumroll&gt;</tt>: <tt><A href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gstreamer/gstreamer-0.0.9.tar.gz">gstreamer-0.0.9.tar.gz</A></tt>

    <content><A href="http://effectv.sourceforge.net/">EffecTV</A> is a cool project which allows you to add real-time effects to a video stream captured from a v4l-device.  Combining this with GStreamer allows you to use any effecTV plugin in any pipeline.  This can easily let you do really nice things.  Here's an example.
<p>
Starting from <A href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg">Alien Song</A>, we first run the pipeline
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/>{ queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! agingTV ! colorspace ! <BR/> mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-age.mpg }</PRE> to re-encode the movie with the agingTV effect.  This is the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-age.mpg">result</A>.
</p><p>
Next, we re-encode the same video using the edgeTV plug-in :
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/>{ queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! edgeTV ! colorspace ! <BR/> mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-edge.mpg }</PRE>
This is the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-edge.mpg">result.</A>
</p><p>Finally, we add the effects; we create an aged version of the edgy version.  This is where GStreamer really shines; in effectv you have to use loopback v4l devices.
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/> { queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! edgeTV ! <BR/> agingTV ! colorspace ! mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-edge-age.mpg }</PRE>
And here's the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-edge-age.mpg">result.</A>
</p><p>
We hope to work with the effecTV authors to provide a convenient library which will allow easy access to these great effects.
</p><p>
The effecTV plug-ins : soon coming to a gst-enabled video editor near you !
</p><p>
<I>sample created movies lack sound and encoding has been ctrl-c'd at random moments because I'm lazy.  Colorspace is necessary because the effecTV plugins work in the RGB colorspace and MPEG video works in the YUV colorspace.  The effecTV have just been added to CVS code and will be in the next stable GStreamer release.
</I>
Here's screenshots of three different effects applied on the alien-song movie:

    <title>gst-player officially unmaintained and deprecated</title>
    <content>
<p>
gst-player has been part of GStreamer almost from day one, but only been
maintained at irregular intervals. Currently it is quite broken in many cases
and we have due to this decided to officially remove it from the project as
today there are better alternatives. This means all references to the player
have been removed and the bugzilla entry will also be removed. If you are
looking for a GTK+-based video player using GStreamer we recommend <a

    <title>GStreamer licensing advisory online</title>
    <content>
<p>
GStreamer is a project which aims to fullfill an important part of the
infrastructure for free and open source operating systems. As a result of this
we need to make sure everything we do is licensed in a way that enables us to
fullfill this role well. To help ensure this we have, after a lot of discussion
and gathering of external feedback, put together <a
href="&site;/documentation/licensing.html">this
licensing advisory</a>. It explains both how plugins for GStreamer will have to
be licensed for us to approve them for inclusion and suggestions for how free
software developers should license their software to solve the practical
problems facing us today. We strongly advise everyone to read this. The content
of this advisory is also included in our FAQ.  </p>

    <title>GStreamer on Symbian OS</title>
    <content>
      <p>
        GStreamer is now ported on Symbian platform. The GStreamer core version ported is v0.10.19.
        It works with the S60 SDK versions  3.2 and 5.0. It has been tested with the Nokia 5800
        XpressMusic and N78 phone models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial package contains:
        <ul>
          <li>gstreamer core</li>
          <li>gst-plugins-base</li>
          <li>audio source and sink elements for symbian</li>
          <li>some gst-good-plugins</li>
          <li>Test application</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next steps are to integrate the changes step by step with the official
        source tree.

        The GStreamer mailing lists have been moved to freedesktop.org. All
        subscriptions should automatically have been moved over to the new
        lists, subscribers should have received welcome e-mails from the new
        lists already. If not, please check your SPAM filters and other e-mail
        filters and head to http://lists.freedesktop.org to re-subscribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old mailing lists will be disabled (posts should be rejected with
        a message that the list has moved) and subscriptions will be disabled.
        After a transition period people will be unsubscribed from the old
        lists automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter any problems with the mailing list move, please

    <title>GStreamer core and Base Plugins 0.10.34 stable release</title>
<content>
<p>
The GStreamer team announces a new release of the GStreamer core and
gst-plugins-base modules for the 0.10 GStreamer stable release series.
</p>
<p>
This is an ad-hoc bug-fix release that fixes a thread-safety issue with the
widely-used multiqueue element, and a corner case timestamping issue in
basesrc. It is identical to the 0.10.33 release otherwise. gst-plugins-base
0.10.34 is fully identical to 0.10.33 and was just made to keep core/base
version numbers in sync.
