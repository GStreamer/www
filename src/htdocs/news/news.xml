    <content><p>As of 9:10pm PST Oct 31, 1999, GStreamer has officially become a public
project.  I've released 0.0.9, in it's current somewhat sorry state, to
get it out to anyone who wants to look around.  A 0.1.0 release is planned
in the near future (a couple weeks away, maybe) with a lot more of the
plugins actually working, but for now it's still pretty cool.</p>

<p><tt>&lt;drumroll&gt;</tt>And here it
is...<tt>&lt;/drumroll&gt;</tt>: <tt><A href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gstreamer/gstreamer-0.0.9.tar.gz">gstreamer-0.0.9.tar.gz</A></tt>

    <content><A href="http://effectv.sourceforge.net/">EffecTV</A> is a cool project which allows you to add real-time effects to a video stream captured from a v4l-device.  Combining this with GStreamer allows you to use any effecTV plugin in any pipeline.  This can easily let you do really nice things.  Here's an example.
<p>
Starting from <A href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg">Alien Song</A>, we first run the pipeline
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/>{ queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! agingTV ! colorspace ! <BR/> mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-age.mpg }</PRE> to re-encode the movie with the agingTV effect.  This is the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-age.mpg">result</A>.
</p><p>
Next, we re-encode the same video using the edgeTV plug-in :
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/>{ queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! edgeTV ! colorspace ! <BR/> mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-edge.mpg }</PRE>
This is the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-edge.mpg">result.</A>
</p><p>Finally, we add the effects; we create an aged version of the edgy version.  This is where GStreamer really shines; in effectv you have to use loopback v4l devices.
<PRE>gst-launch gnomevfssrc location="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/medium/alien.mpg" ! mpegdemux video_%02d! <BR/> { queue ! mpeg2dec ! colorspace ! edgeTV ! <BR/> agingTV ! colorspace ! mpeg2enc ! disksink location=alien-edge-age.mpg }</PRE>
And here's the <A href="http://gstreamer.net/media/alien-edge-age.mpg">result.</A>
</p><p>
We hope to work with the effecTV authors to provide a convenient library which will allow easy access to these great effects.
</p><p>
The effecTV plug-ins : soon coming to a gst-enabled video editor near you !
</p><p>
<I>sample created movies lack sound and encoding has been ctrl-c'd at random moments because I'm lazy.  Colorspace is necessary because the effecTV plugins work in the RGB colorspace and MPEG video works in the YUV colorspace.  The effecTV have just been added to CVS code and will be in the next stable GStreamer release.
</I>
Here's screenshots of three different effects applied on the alien-song movie:

    <title>gst-player officially unmaintained and deprecated</title>
    <content>
<p>
gst-player has been part of GStreamer almost from day one, but only been
maintained at irregular intervals. Currently it is quite broken in many cases
and we have due to this decided to officially remove it from the project as
today there are better alternatives. This means all references to the player
have been removed and the bugzilla entry will also be removed. If you are
looking for a GTK+-based video player using GStreamer we recommend <a

    <title>GStreamer licensing advisory online</title>
    <content>
<p>
GStreamer is a project which aims to fullfill an important part of the
infrastructure for free and open source operating systems. As a result of this
we need to make sure everything we do is licensed in a way that enables us to
fullfill this role well. To help ensure this we have, after a lot of discussion
and gathering of external feedback, put together <a
href="&site;/documentation/licensing.html">this
licensing advisory</a>. It explains both how plugins for GStreamer will have to
be licensed for us to approve them for inclusion and suggestions for how free
software developers should license their software to solve the practical
problems facing us today. We strongly advise everyone to read this. The content
of this advisory is also included in our FAQ.  </p>

    <title>GStreamer on Symbian OS</title>
    <content>
      <p>
        GStreamer is now ported on Symbian platform. The GStreamer core version ported is v0.10.19.
        It works with the S60 SDK versions  3.2 and 5.0. It has been tested with the Nokia 5800
        XpressMusic and N78 phone models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial package contains:
        <ul>
          <li>gstreamer core</li>
          <li>gst-plugins-base</li>
          <li>audio source and sink elements for symbian</li>
          <li>some gst-good-plugins</li>
          <li>Test application</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next steps are to integrate the changes step by step with the official
        source tree.

        The GStreamer mailing lists have been moved to freedesktop.org. All
        subscriptions should automatically have been moved over to the new
        lists, subscribers should have received welcome e-mails from the new

        filters and head to http://lists.freedesktop.org to re-subscribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old mailing lists will be disabled (posts should be rejected with
        a message that the list has moved) and subscriptions will be disabled.
        After a transition period people will be unsubscribed from the old
        lists automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter any problems with the mailing list move, please

    <title>GStreamer core and Base Plugins 0.10.34 stable release</title>
<content>
<p>
The GStreamer team announces a new release of the GStreamer core and
gst-plugins-base modules for the 0.10 GStreamer stable release series.
</p>
<p>
This is an ad-hoc bug-fix release that fixes a thread-safety issue with the
widely-used multiqueue element, and a corner case timestamping issue in
basesrc. It is identical to the 0.10.33 release otherwise. gst-plugins-base
0.10.34 is fully identical to 0.10.33 and was just made to keep core/base
version numbers in sync.

        <title>GStreamer 1.0 released</title>
        <content>
        <p>
The GStreamer project is pleased to announce the very first release of
the new API and ABI-stable 1.x series of the GStreamer multimedia
framework.
        </p>
        <p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.
        </p>
        <p>
Major improvements include:
        <ul>
<li>more flexible memory handling</li>
<li>extensible and negotiable metadata for buffers</li>
<li>caps negotiation and renegotiation mechanisms, decoupled from buffer allocation</li>
<li>improved caps renegotiation</li>
<li>automatic re-sending of state for dynamic pipelines</li>
<li>reworked and more fine-grained pad probing</li>
<li>simpler and more descriptive audio and video caps</li>
<li>more efficient allocation of buffers, events and other mini objects</li>
<li>improved timestamp handling</li>
<li>support for gobject-inspection-based language bindings</li>
<li>countless other improvements</li>
        </ul>
An overview of the architectural changes can be found in
<a href="http://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/keynote-gstreamer-10/">Wim Tayman's GStreamer 1.0 keynote</a>
from the GStreamer Conference 2012 in San Diego (click on the 'Share' tab for other video formats).
        </p>
        <p>
Most of these changes involve the GStreamer plugin API. The application
API has changed comparatively little, and most applications should be
fairly easy to port to the new API. There is a
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/tree/docs/random/porting-to-1.0.txt">porting guide</a>
available.
        </p>
        <p>
The GStreamer team would like to thank everyone who helped bring this
release about, whether by submitting patches, reporting bugs, testing,
sponsoring development, attending hackfests, or simply supplying moral
support.
        </p>
        <p>
This is the end of a long development process, but also the beginning of
one. This release does not mark the pinnacle of perfection, but the
point where the team is content with the API and stability and quality
of the code base in general, especially compared to the old 0.10 series.
        </p>
        <p>
There will be bugs to fix, and starting from this release there will be
distinct bug-fixing and feature development cycles, with the goal of
getting bug-fixes out quicker and unencumbered by other more risky
changes. See the
<a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/wiki/ReleasePlanning/RoadMap">ReleasePlanning/RoadMap page on the wiki</a>
for a tentative road map and possible schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
Please also note that we may still need to fine-tune some minor aspects
of plugin behaviour in the next development cycle (e.g. bufferpool
draining on renegotiation), so keep an eye out for that when porting
elements over.
        </p>

        <title>GStreamer 0.10 no longer maintained</title>
        <content>
        <p>
Since this has never been announced officially outside of the conference
circuit, the GStreamer team would like to
<a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/gstreamer-announce/2013-March/000273.html">clarify</a>
that GStreamer 0.10 is no longer maintained. Not by us, nor by anyone else.
There will be no more GStreamer 0.10 releases, not even bug-fix releases.
Bugs will not be investigated unless they also apply to GStreamer 1.x.
Patches will only be reviewed and pushed if they apply to one of the
current 1.x branches or fix an issue that still pertains to 1.x.
Bug fixes have not been backported systematically to 0.10 for a very long
time now, and there are many hundreds of bugs that have only been fixed
in 1.x, and manymore are fixed every week. Any commits to the 0.10 branch
are made purely on an ad-hoc basis now, and we may lock down the branch
completely. No more features will be added to 0.10. However, GStreamer 0.10
support is of course still available on a commercial basis from the usual
suspects.
        </p>
        <p>
We realise and regret that this may cause some inconvenience, and we
also understand that there are circumstances where there are valid
reasons not to migrate to 1.0 at this time, or in some cases ever, but
we would also like to dispel any doubt whatsoever that there is any
other way. We have neither the resources, nor the will or the energy to
maintain more than one major version. We must use the little resources
we have on code that has a future.
        </p>
        <p>
We are happy to provide help and advice to anyone migrating to 1.0. If
there are plugins that haven't been ported yet that you need, let us
know, maybe we can help get them ported.
        </p>
        <p>
Thanks for your understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
Happy hacking, see you on the other side!
        </p>

        <title>GStreamer Core, Plugins and RTSP server 1.3.90 release candidate</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
the stable 1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features
on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided together with this
release.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4 release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x, 1.2.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.2.x it contains some
new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too risky as a
bugfix.

The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4.x release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.0.x it contains
some new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too
risky as a bugfix.

        <title>gst-editing-services, gst-python and gnonlin  1.3.90 release candidate</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
the stable 1.4 release series of gst-editing-services, gst-python and gnonlin.
The 1.4 release series is adding new features
on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4 release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x, 1.2.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.2.x it contains some
new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too risky as a
bugfix.

        <title>GStreamer Core and Plugins 1.5.1 development release</title>
        <content>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release of the unstable
1.5 release series. The 1.5 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.5 release series
will lead to the stable 1.6 release series in the next weeks, and newly added
API can still change until that point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the unstable 1.5 release series.
</p>
