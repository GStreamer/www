  <version>1.4.4</version>

  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a bugfix release of the stable
1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features on top
of the 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework that contains new features.
The 1.4.x bugfix releases only contain important bugfixes compared to 1.4.0.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided by the
GStreamer project for this release.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4.x release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.0.x it contains
some new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too
risky as a bugfix.

<i>"Such ingratitude.  After all the times I've saved your life."</i>
</p>
<p>
A collection of plugins you'd want to have right next to you on the
battlefield.  Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plugins have it
all: good looks, good code, and good licensing.  Documented and dressed up
in tests.  If you're looking for a role model to base your own plugin on,
here it is.
</p>
<p>
If you find a plot hole or a badly lip-synced line of code in them,
let us know - it is a matter of honour for us to ensure Blondie doesn't look
like he's been walking 100 miles through the desert without water.
</p>
<p>
This module contains a set of plugins that we consider to have good quality
  code, correct functionality, our preferred license (LGPL for the plugin
  code, LGPL or LGPL-compatible for the supporting library).
We believe distributors can safely ship these plugins.
People writing elements should base their code on these elements.
</p>

    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests</dd>

<dd>contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)</dd>
