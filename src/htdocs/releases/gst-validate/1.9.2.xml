  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release of the unstable
1.9 release series, which marks the feature freeze for 1.10. The 1.9 release
series is adding new features on top of the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 series
and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer
multimedia framework. The unstable 1.9 release series will lead to the stable
1.10 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added API can still change
until that point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided in the next days.
</p>

<p>
  This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
  to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
  others.
</p>

<p>
  It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
  gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>

<p>
  GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
  test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
  so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
