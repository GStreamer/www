</p>
<p>
This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
others.
</p>

<p>
It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>

<p>
GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
