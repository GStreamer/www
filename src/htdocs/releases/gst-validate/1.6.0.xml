<p>
  The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the 1.6 stable release of
  GstValidate, a high level integration testing infrastructure for the GStreamer
  framework.
</p>

<p>
  This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
  to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
  others.
</p>

<p>
  It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
  gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>

<p>
  GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
  test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
  so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
