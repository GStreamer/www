  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the stable
1.8 release series. The 1.8 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the stable 1.8 release series.
</p>

<p>
  This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
  to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
  others.
</p>

<p>
  It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
  gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>

<p>
  GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
  test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
  so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
