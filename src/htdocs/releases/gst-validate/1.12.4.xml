  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce the fourth bugfix release in the stable
1.12 release series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!
</p>
<p>
This release only contains bugfixes and it is safe to update from 1.12.x. For a
full list of bugfixes see <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;classification=Platform&amp;limit=0&amp;list_id=270310&amp;order=bug_id&amp;product=GStreamer&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;target_milestone=1.12.4">Bugzilla</a>.

</p>
<p>
This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>
<p>
This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
others.
</p>
<p>
It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>
<p>
GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
