  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release of the unstable
1.9 release series. The 1.9 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.9 release series
will lead to the stable 1.10 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added
API can still change until that point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided in the next days.
</p>

<p>
This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
others.
</p>

<p>
It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>

<p>
GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
