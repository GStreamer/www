  <intro>

<p>
  The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
  the stable 1.4 release series of GstValidate, a high level
  integration testing infrastructure for the GStreamer
  framework.
</p>

<p>
  This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
  release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
  testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
  the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>

<p>
  This module contains a whole testing infrastructure to help GStreamer developers
  to validate their elements, check the interaction between their element and the
  others.
</p>

<p>
  It allows to easily implement high level integration testsuite running scenarios on
  gstreamer pipeline checking that each element in the pipeline is behaving as expected.
</p>

<p>
  GstValidate also provide a default testsuite so that third party developers can
  test and validate their elements, this testsuite is also running on an integration server
  so that the upstream GStreamer project can detect any regression.
