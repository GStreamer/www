  <version>0.8.0</version>

  <intro>
<p>
This is the 0.8.0 release of the GStreamer Player. It should be used with
the 0.8.x series of GStreamer, GStreamer Plug-ins and GStreamer FFmpeg.
</p>
<p>
The player is now rather mature and should be be able to play back all
media supported by the GStreamer framework including mp3, ogg, flac, mpeg,
avi, vob, mod and others. While it does support audio formats, it is
designed to primarly be a video player. 
</p>
<p>
The player is our primary test bed for GStreamer, to show off the things
GStreamer provides.  It is not the primary player of choice for desktops.
For example, in GNOME, Totem is preferred, using the same backend as
GStreamer Player.
