  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 1.x stable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series and
will not affect an existing 0.10.x installation.
</p>

<p>
This module contains plugins based on the libav project, including codecs.
</p>

    and/or unit tests</dd>

<p>In addition to the above contributors, we would like to extend our
thanks to the libav developers without which these plugins would have
no reason to exist.</p>
