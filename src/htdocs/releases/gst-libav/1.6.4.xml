  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a new bug-fix release in the
old 1.6 stable series of the core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.
</p>
<p>
This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from 1.6.x.
For a full list of bugfixes see Bugzilla.
</p> 
<p>
This release maintains API/ABI backwards compatibility with the
GStreamer 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 release series.
</p>

<p>
This module contains plugins based on the libav project, including codecs.
</p>

<dt>gst-plugins-good</dt>

<p>In addition to the above contributors, we would like to extend our
thanks to the libav developers without which these plugins would have
no reason to exist.</p>
