  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release candidate for the
stable 1.6 release series. The 1.6 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The final 1.6.0 release is planned
in the next few days unless any major bugs are found.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately by
the GStreamer project.
