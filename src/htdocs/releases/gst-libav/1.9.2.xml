  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release of the unstable
1.9 release series, which marks the feature freeze for 1.10. The 1.9 release
series is adding new features on top of the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 series
and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer
multimedia framework. The unstable 1.9 release series will lead to the stable
1.10 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added API can still change
until that point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided in the next days.
