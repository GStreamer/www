  <version>0.11.91</version>

  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.11.x unstable series of the
GStreamer libav Plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
The 0.11.x series is an unstable series targeted at developers and will
eventually lead up to the stable 1.0 series.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series.
</p>

<p>
This module contains plug-ins using libraries from the libav project.
</p>

Other modules containing plug-ins are:

<dt>gst-plugins-ugly</dt>
<dd>contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors</dd>
<dt>gst-plugins-bad</dt>
<dd>contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
