The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release of the new stable
1.10 release series. The 1.10 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.

Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided shortly after
the source release by the GStreamer project during the stable 1.10 release
series.
