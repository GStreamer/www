## Bugs fixed in 1.14

- this section will be filled in shortly

More than [704 bugs][bugs-fixed-in-1.14] have been fixed during
the development of 1.14.

This list does not include issues that have been cherry-picked into the
stable 1.12 branch and fixed there as well, all fixes that ended up in the
1.12 branch are also included in 1.14.

This list also does not include issues that have been fixed without a bug
report in bugzilla, so the actual number of fixes is much higher.

[bugs-fixed-in-1.14]: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&classification=Platform&limit=0&list_id=213265&order=bug_id&product=GStreamer&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=1.12.1&target_milestone=1.12.2&target_milestone=1.12.3&target_milestone=1.12.4&target_milestone=1.13.1&target_milestone=1.13.2&target_milestone=1.13.3&target_milestone=1.13.4&target_milestone=1.13.90&target_milestone=1.13.91&target_milestone=1.14.0

## Stable 1.14 branch

After the 1.14.0 release there will be several 1.14.x bug-fix releases which
will contain bug fixes which have been deemed suitable for a stable branch,
but no new features or intrusive changes will be added to a bug-fix release
usually. The 1.14.x bug-fix releases will be made from the git 1.14 branch,
which is a stable branch.

### 1.14.0

1.14.0 is scheduled to be released in late February / early March 2018.

## Known Issues

- The `webrtcdsp` element is currently not shipped as part of the Windows
  binary packages due to a [build system issue][bug-770264].

[bug-770264]: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770264

## Schedule for 1.16

Our next major feature release will be 1.16, and 1.15 will be the unstable
development version leading up to the stable 1.16 release. The development
of 1.15/1.16 will happen in the git master branch.

The plan for the 1.16 development cycle is yet to be confirmed, but it is
expected that feature freeze will be around August 2017
followed by several 1.15 pre-releases and the new 1.16 stable release
in September.

1.16 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.14, 1.12, 1.10, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4,
1.2 and 1.0 release series.
