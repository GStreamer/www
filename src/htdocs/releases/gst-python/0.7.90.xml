  <intro>
<p>
This is the 0.7.90 release of the GStreamer Python bindings. It should be used with
the 0.8.x series of GStreamer, GStreamer Plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
This is the first release of python bindings for 0.8.x of GStreamer.
It's still rather immature and should be used with caution.
However, it's still very possible to write simple and medium sized applications
using gstreamer, like music players and simple video players.
