  <version>1.3.90</version>

  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
the stable 1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features
on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>
<p>
This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided together with this
release.
</p>
<p>
The stable 1.4 release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x, 1.2.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.2.x it contains some
new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too risky as a
bugfix.

<p>
