  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release of
the stable 1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new
features on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and
ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
</p>

<p>
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided together
with this release.
</p>

<p>
The stable 1.4 release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x,
1.2.x and any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.2.x
it contains some new features and more intrusive changes that were
considered too risky as a bugfix.
