  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce the fourth bugfix release in the stable
1.10 release series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!
</p>
<p>
This release only contains bugfixes and it is safe to update from 1.10.x. For a
full list of bugfixes see <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;classification=Platform&amp;limit=0&amp;list_id=187054&amp;order=bug_id&amp;product=GStreamer&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;target_milestone=1.10.4">Bugzilla</a>.

<i>"That an accusation?"</i>
</p>
<p>
No perfectly groomed moustache or any amount of fine clothing is going to
cover up the truth - these plugins are Bad with a capital B.
They look fine on the outside, and might even appear to get the job done, but
at the end of the day they're a black sheep. Without a golden-haired angel
to watch over them, they'll probably land in an unmarked grave at the final
showdown.
</p>
<p>
Don't bug us about their quality - exercise your Free Software rights,
patch up the offender and send us the patch on the fastest steed you can
steal from the Confederates. Because you see, in this world, there's two
kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig.
You dig.
</p>
<p>
This module contains a set of plugins that aren't up to par compared to the
rest.  They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing something
- be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live
maintainer, or some actual wide use.  If the blanks are filled in they might be
upgraded to become part of either gst-plugins-good or gst-plugins-ugly,
depending on the other factors.
If the plugins break, you can't complain - instead, you can fix the
problem and send us a patch, or bribe someone into fixing them for you.
New contributors can start here for things to work on.
