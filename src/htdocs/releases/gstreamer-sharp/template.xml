  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce a first development release
of the GStreamer C# bindings for the 0.10.x release series.
</p>
<p>
The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.
</p>
<p><strong>Please note that at this time the GStreamer C# bindings
        are not consindered API/ABI stable, and public interfaces
	may still change from release to release. These changes
	will most likely be small. Please read the README file
	for more information on this.</strong>
