  <version>0.8.5</version>

  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer streaming-media framework.
</p>
<p>
The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.
</p>
<p>
This module only contains core functionality.  For actual media playback,
you will need other modules.  GStreamer Plugins contains a huge set of
additional plugins.  GStreamer FFmpeg contains a plugin based on the popular
FFmpeg decoding library.  These modules need not have the same source version
as the core, as long as they are in the 0.8.x series.

  <issues>
    <issue>Some applications may print warnings on the console saying
something like:
 GStreamer-WARNING **: pad xvimagesink0:sink returned caps that are not a
real subset of its template caps.

It is safe to ignore this warning.  It will be fixed in the next release
of the GStreamer Plugins.

    <additions>
      <item>A new function, gst_scheduler_register, has been added.</item>
      <item>A new enum member of GstBufferFlag, GST_BUFFER_DELTA_UNIT has been added.</item>
    </additions>
    <depreciations>
      <item>GstBufferFlag has a deprecated enum member, GST_BUFFER_KEY_UNIT.
Buffers should be marked with GST_BUFFER_DELTA_UNIT when they're not
key units instead, since key units are the more common case.</item>
