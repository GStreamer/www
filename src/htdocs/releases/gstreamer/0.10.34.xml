  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.
</p>
<p>
The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.
</p>
<p>
The 0.10.x series has been reworked for threadsafety.  It also features
various feature additions and enhancements.
</p>
<p>
This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.
