  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer streaming-media framework.
</p>
<p>
The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.
</p>
<p>
This module only contains core functionality.  For actual media playback,
you will need other modules.  GStreamer Plug-ins contains a huge set of
additional plugins.  GStreamer FFmpeg contains a plugin based on the popular
FFmpeg decoding library.  These modules need not have the same source version
as the core, as long as they are in the 0.8.x series.
