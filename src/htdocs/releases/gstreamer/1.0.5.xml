  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a new bug-fix release
in the 1.x stable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series and
will not affect an existing 0.10.x installation.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series has been reworked for more flexible memory handling, improved
caps negotiation and re-negotiation, better handling of dynamic pipelines,
and increased performance in general. It also features countless other feature
additions and enhancements.
</p>
<p>
This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

  <features>
    <feature>add GST_BIN_FLAG_NO_RESYNC flag that disables a resync when
      an element is added, removed or linked in the bin; this is
      interesting for complex bins that dynamically add elements
      to themselves and want to manage the state of those elements
      without interference from state resync threads (which may
      cause deadlocks)</feature>
    <feature>add OTHER clock type</feature>
  </features>
