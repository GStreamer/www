  <intro>

<p>
The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new bug-fix release
in the 1.x stable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series and
will not affect an existing 0.10.x installation.
</p>
<p>
The 1.x series has been reworked for more flexible memory handling, improved
caps negotiation and re-negotiation, better handling of dynamic pipelines,
and increased performance in general. It also features countless other feature
additions and enhancements.
</p>
<p>
This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

  <features>
     <feature>basesink: when we asynchronously go from READY to PLAYING, also
              call the state change function so that subclasses can update
              their state for PLAYING, esp. audio sinks added to the pipeline
              dynamically</feature>
     <feature>bindings: gobject-introspection annotation fixes</feature>
