  <module-fancy>GStreamer Ugly Plugins</module-fancy>
  <name></name>
  <version>1.6.4</version>

  <intro>
<p>
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a new bug-fix release in the
old 1.6 stable series of the core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.
</p>
<p>
This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from 1.6.x.
For a full list of bugfixes see Bugzilla.
</p> 
<p>
This release maintains API/ABI backwards compatibility with the
GStreamer 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 release series.
</p>

<i>"When you have to shoot, shoot.  Don't talk."</i>
</p>
<p>
There are times when the world needs a color between black and white.
Quality code to match the good's, but two-timing, backstabbing and ready to
sell your freedom down the river.  These plugins might have a patent noose
around their neck, or a lock-up license, or any other problem that makes you
think twice about shipping them.
</p>
<p>
We don't call them ugly because we like them less.  Does a mother love her
son less because he's not as pretty as the other ones ? No  - she commends
him on his great personality.  These plugins are the life of the party.
And we'll still step in and set them straight if you report any unacceptable
behaviour - because there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend:
those with a rope around their neck and the people who do the cutting.
</p>
<p>
This module contains a set of plugins that have good quality and correct
functionality, but distributing them might pose problems.  The license
on either the plugins or the supporting libraries might not be how we'd
like. The code might be widely known to present patent problems.
Distributors should check if they want/can ship these plugins.

    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests</dd>
<dt>gst-libav</dt>
<dd>contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)</dd>
