<h1>Developer Information</h1>

<p>Much documentation and some introductory slides are to be found on the
<a HREF="&site;/documentation/">Documentation page</a>. We suggest to read
the manual and the slides to get a general overview and to get you started.</p>
                                                                                
<p>New developers are welcome to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to the core library.</li>
<li>Write plugins for GStreamer.</li>
<li>Write applications using GStreamer.</li>
<li>Write a lot of <a href="&site;/bindings/">language bindings</a>.</li>
<li>Contribute to the documentation.</li>
<li>Build test cases.</li>
</ul>

<!-- FIXME: dotplan back in action or not ? -->

<p>The developers tend to live in IRC on <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, in
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/gstreamer">#gstreamer</a>. <!-- Sketching ideas and making plans can be done on the
<a href="&site;/wiki">gstreamer wiki</a>. -->
</p>
                                                                                
<H1>Git access</H1>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>
The repository is split in several <a href="&site;/modules/">modules</a>.
</p>

<h2>Anonymous Git Access</h2>
<p>
This project is hosted on the <a
href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/">freedesktop.org
GitLab</a>. The Git repositories can be checked out through anonymous
Git with the following instructions. The module you wish to check out
must be specified as the modulename. To determine the names of the
modules created by this project, you may examine their Git repository
via the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/">GitLab
interface</a>.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/modulename.git
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Contributing to GStreamer</h2>
<p>
You do not need a developer account in order to work on GStreamer. Anonymous git
access should be sufficient for that, and it's easy to maintain personal git
branches by <a
href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/fork-project.html">forking</a>
the repository in your GitLab user space. Patches can then be submitted as <a
href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/help/user/project/merge_requests/index.md">Merge
Requests</a> against the appropriate module.
</p>
<p>
Developers will be added to the project for write access as necessary.  For all
other changes, please submit patches via Merge Requests as mentioned above.

<!-- or send it to the <A HREF="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/gstreamer-devel">gstreamer-devel list</A>. -->
</p>

<h2>Developer Guidelines</h2>

<p>Best practices for making patches and/or committing to GStreamer git can
be found on the <a href="&site;/wiki/GitDeveloperGuidelines">GitDeveloperGuidelines</a>
wiki page.

<H1>Continuous integration: Build bots and validation</H1>

<p>
Commits to Git are verified by our build cluster. This does automated checkouts
on a series of slaves and runs the build there, as well as an extensive media
validation test suite. If a commit breaks a build it is announced in
the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/gstreamer"><tt>#gstreamer</tt> IRC channel</a>
and on the <a href="https://ci.gstreamer.net/">GStreamer Continuous Integration</a>
website.
</p>

<p>This will eventually be merged to use GitLab-CI in a near future</p>

<H1>Language Bindings</H1>
                                                                                
<p>The GStreamer API can be accessed from <a href="../bindings">various programming languages</a> in addition to the native C API.</p>
