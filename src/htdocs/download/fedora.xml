  <title>GStreamer: download for Fedora Core</title>
  <body>

<h2>Download instructions for Fedora Core</h2>
<P>
GStreamer is distributed with Fedora Core.
Fedora Core 2, 3, and 4 have shipped with GStreamer 0.8
</P>

<P>
GStreamer 0.10 is new and not included in Fedora yet.
Our repository contains packages for Fedora Core 4 in a separate repository.
</P>

<P>
If you want to get updates and additional plug-ins for GStreamer 0.8,
you have two options:

<UL>
<LI>Use the repository hosted by us, which is compatible with
Fedora Extras,
<A href="http://www.fedora.us/">www.fedora.us</A> and
<A href="http://rpm.livna.org/">rpm.livna.org</A>.
This repository has both packages not in the base distribution mirrored
from those two sites, as well as packages created by us and submitted back
to those two repositories.</LI>
<LI>Use the <A href="http://www.freshrpms.net/">FreshRPMS repository</A>, where
the GStreamer packages are packaged in the same way as ours.</LI>
</UL>


</P>
<H2>Our repository</H2>
<P>
Here's the five step guide to getting our packages.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>
You can use either yum or apt for rpm.
The current repository contains packages built using
<A href="http://thomas.apestaart.org/projects/mach">mach</A>.
They should also be compatible with the Fedora Core
test releases if you keep your system upgraded.
</P>
<P>
If you use apt,
then add these two lines to your sources.list file, or your sources.list
directory:
<PRE>
rpm     http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/ fedora/4/i386 deps gst
rpm-src http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/ fedora/4/i386 deps gst
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Make sure you change the version number if you use a different version.
</P>
<P>
If you use yum. add these lines to your yum.conf file:
<PRE>
[gstreamer-deps]
name=Fedora Core $releasever - $basearch - GStreamer dependencies
baseurl=http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/fedora/$releasever/$basearch/yum/deps

[gstreamer]
name=Fedora Core $releasever - $basearch - GStreamer
baseurl=http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/fedora/$releasever/$basearch/yum/gst
</PRE>
</P>
</LI>

<LI>Import the GPG key for this repository if you haven't already done so:
<DL>

<DT>
Get key and fingerprint from website:
</DT>
<DD><PRE>
wget http://thomas.apestaart.org/pkg/thomas.pubkey
wget http://thomas.apestaart.org/pkg/thomas.fingerprint
</PRE></DD>

<DT>
Verify that the fingerprint matches the pubkey:
</DT>
<DD><PRE>
gpg --with-fingerprint thomas.pubkey | head -n 3 | diff - thomas.fingerprint
</PRE></DD>

<DT>
Get the public key from a keyserver and verify that the online fingerprint
matches the one downloaded:
</DT>
<DD><PRE>
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 55f3aa6f
gpg --list-keys | grep Stichele
gpg --fingerprint 55f3aa6f | head -n 3 > thomas.fingerprint.tmp
diff thomas.fingerprint.tmp thomas.fingerprint
</PRE></DD>

<DT>
Now that you verified the validity of thomas.pubkey, you can import it in
your rpm database using
</DT>
<DD><PRE>
rpm --import thomas.pubkey
</PRE></DD>
</DL>
</LI>

<LI>Import the GPG key for <A href="http://rpm.livna.org/">rpm.livna.org</A>
by following the instructions on their site.
</LI>

<LI>
Install all GStreamer packages:
<UL>
<LI>
Using apt:
<PRE>
apt-get update
apt-get install gstreamer-universe
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>
Using yum:
<PRE>
yum install gstreamer-universe
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<P>
If this gives problems, it is probably due to you having installed packages
from another repository.  Try removing those packages, or only installing
part of the GStreamer package set.
</P>

You can also <A href="&site;/pkg/fedora">browse the repository</A>.
