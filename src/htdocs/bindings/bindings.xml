<p>The GStreamer bindings for the .NET framework, known as Gst#
(gst-sharp), are implemented using C#, a modern object-oriented
language defined by the ECMA-334 standard. However, applications making use
of the bindings can be written in any language supported by the .NET runtime,
including but not limited to C#, Visual Basic, Managed C++, Python, Perl,
Java and JavaScript.</p>
                                                                                
<p>The bindings are generated in two steps by the
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono project</a>'s
<a href="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">Gtk#</a> code parser, which
produces an intermediate XML representation of the API, and code generator
which processes the XML to produce the bindings themselves. Few custom
modifications are required to the code once generated, making it possible to
provide up-to-date .NET bindings at the same time as every major and minor
GStreamer release.</p>
                                                                                
<p>Gst# is still at an early stage of development so many areas of its
functionality remain untested. In particular, users should not expect a
stable API between releases.</p>
 
<p>The bindings are present in the module (<tt>gst-sharp</tt>) of <a
href="http://www.go-mono.com/anoncvs.html">Mono's CVS tree</a> but
there are currentl no released packages.
</p>
 
<p>Gst# is being developed primarily on GNU/Linux using the Mono JIT runtime
on x86. Users are encouraged to try different platforms and report the
extent of their success.</p>
 
<h2>Documentation and Examples</h2>
 
<p>Gst# includes monodoc documentation, although it is currently very
incomplete. A couple of examples are provided in the <tt>sample/</tt>
directory of the Gst# distribution.</p>
                                                                                
<h2>Applications</h2>
                                                                                
<p>There are only a handful of applications that make use of Gst# right now,
but this situation is expected to improve as GStreamer and Mono continue to
reach a wider audience.</p>

The GStreamer API <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html">C++</a>
bindings are still under development.The bindings are based upon <a
href="http://www.gtkmm.org">gtkmm</a>. It's using the same lifecycle mechanism.
A modified version of gtkmmproc autogenerates the code. Further work needs to bedone there.

Currently, the following classes are either fully or partially implemented:
