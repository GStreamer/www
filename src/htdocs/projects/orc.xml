<h1>GStreamer Project: ORC Acceleration</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
Orc is basically a simplified assembly language for data processing (no loops/jumps etc.),
it's supposed to map to SIMD instructions on various architectures curently there
are two things:
<ul>
  <li>liborc, which is a JIT compiler that will at run-time take orc code (in some byte
format) and generate machine code for the architecture in question on the fly and then
execute that whenever there's a function call</li>
  <li>we have C backup functions as .c files in the gstreamer source code, which are
also compiled in when orc can't compile some code (for various reasons), or liborc is
not available, then the C backup function will be used that's the current state of
things.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Currently there is no ARM64/AArch64 support in ORC. Add this and implement all relevant opcodes to allow usage of most GStreamer ORC programs.
