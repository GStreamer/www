  </p>
  <p>
  This is just after the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference-europe-2019/">Embedded Linux Conference Europe (ELCE)</a>,
  but not officially co-hosted with it and at a different venue in Lyon.
  </p>

<!--

  Talks will be recorded again by <a href="https://www.ubicast.eu/">Ubicast</a> and
  are available at <a href="https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/channels/#gstreamer-conference-2019">GStreamer Conference 2019 videos</a>

  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>
  The GStreamer Conference is a conference for developers, community members,
  decision-makers, industry partners, researchers, students and anyone else
  interested in the GStreamer multimedia framework or Open Source and
  cross-platform multimedia.
  </p>

  <h2>Who should attend?</h2>
  <p>
    Anyone interested in open source cross-platform multimedia is encouraged
    to join us at the GStreamer Conference 2019!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are a hobbyist, app developer, researcher or student interested
    in the field of multimedia, or working for a company that is using or looking
    to use GStreamer in their products, this is the perfect event for you to network
    at and to learn more about the latest technological developments and project news,
    and to meet developers as well as the wider community.
  </p>

  <h2>Registration</h2>
  <p>
  Registration is now open and will stay open until the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b><a href="https://ti.to/gstreamer-conference-tickets/gstreamer-conference-2019">Sign up for the GStreamer Conference here</a></b>
  </p>
  <p>
  There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
    <table width="80%" cellpadding="5">
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Early Bird)</b></td><td><b>219 EUR</b> (ca. 250 USD) (limited in number and available only until 29 Sept)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Regular)</b></td><td><b>330 EUR</b> (ca. 375 USD) (regular)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Supporter)</b></td><td><b>500+ EUR</b> (ca. 565 USD) (for those who want to give a little bit extra to the GStreamer project)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Student/Hobbyist/Community</b></td><td><b>Voluntary contribution</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Speaker</b></td><td><b>Free</b></td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    All tickets include lunch at the venue on both conference days
    as well as access to the social event on Thursday evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
    the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you
    are a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
    If in doubt drop us a mail or just register as hobbyist. The important
    thing is that you'll make it to the conference!

<!--
  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  <p>
  The first batch of talks and speakers will be announced very soon.
  </p>
  <p>
  We still have a few slots available, so talk proposals can still be submitted.
  </p>
  <p><b>
  The call for papers is now open for talk proposals and lightning talks.
  Please submit your talk now!
  </b></p>
  <p>
  The initial submission needs to be only a couple of sentences or paragraphs
  describing the talk you want to give and the desired length of your talk
  (please allow at least 5 minutes for questions at the end as well).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>The talk submission deadline has been extended and is 30 September 2019 for second round slots!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Talks can be on almost anything multimedia related, ranging from talks about
  applications to challenges in the lower levels in the stack or hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
  Talk slots will have one of the following durations: 20 minutes, 30 minutes,
  or 45 minutes, including questions. If you need more time than that we might
  be able to accommodate that as well, please get in touch to discuss details.
  </p>
  <p>
  We want to hear from you, what you are working on, what you are using
  GStreamer for, what difficulties you have encountered and how you solved them,
  what your plans are, what you like, what you dislike, how to improve things!
  </p>
  <p>
  Please send all proposals to <a href="mailto:gstreamer-conference@lists.freedesktop.org">gstreamer-conference<!-x- -x-><i>&#64;</i><!-x- -x->lists.freedesktop.org</a>.

  <h2>Showcase or Lightning Talks</h2>
  <p>
    There will again be opportunities for short lightning talks for those who
    do not wish to present a full talk, but just want to showcase something
    they're working on, or present a problem or challenge they are facing or
    have solved, and that they think might be interesting for others to hear
    about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Want to submit a ca. 5-minute mini-talk for our <i>lightning talk</i>/<i>showcase</i> event?
  </p>
  <p>
    Simply send a quick mail to <a href="mailto:gstreamer-conference@lists.freedesktop.org">gstreamer-conference<!-- --><i>&#64;</i><!-- -->lists.freedesktop.org</a> above to reserve your slot (subject to availability).  </p>
  <p>
    There is no deadline for Lightning Talk submissions, slots will be
    allocated on a first-come first-serve basis.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Events</h2>

  <h3>Wednesday: Welcome drinks and/or food (venue to be determined)</h3>
  <p>
    Join us for some drinks and/or food at <i>tbd</i>. Details to be confirmed
    at a later time. <!-- <a href="https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/lothian-road"><b>BrewDog Lothian Road</b></a>! -->
  </p>
<!--
  <p>
    Food and drinks will be available for purchase, credit cards should be accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a semi-private section reserved for us upstairs on the right ("The Garage").

  <h3>Thursday: Social Event with Food and Drinks (venue to be determined)</h3>
  <p>
    We plan on having a social event again on Thursday, details to be confirmed
    at a later time.
  </p>
<!--
  <p>
    Our main social event will be on Thursday at <a href="http://www.lebowskis.co.uk/edinburgh/our-location.php"><b>Lebowskis Bar</b></a>
    from ca. 19.30 until late. Food and drinks will be provided (thanks to our sponsors!),
    including some vegetarian/vegan options.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lebowskis Bar is located on 18 Morrison Street in the West End near the
  international conference center.
  </p>
  <p>
    How to get there from Summerhall:
    <ul>
      <li>on foot: it's a fairly straight-forward 20-minute walk along the
          main road (A700) through the Meadows, ca. 1 mile.</li>
      <li>by public transport: there should be busses every couple of minutes
          from Bernard Terrace which is just around the corner from Summerhall
          (on the road going north towards Waverley station). The easiest might
          be the number 2 which runs every 10 minutes and takes 17 minutes.
          The airport bus (300) is also an option but might have different
          pricing compared to local busses. The 30 takes a slightly longer
          route so it's probably worth just waiting for the next number 2 then.</li>
      <li>by taxi/uber: should be a 5-10 minutes ride depending on traffic, perhaps £5-10 or so</li>
      <li>by bike: should be less than 10 minutes by bike if you're feeling
          ambitious. There are <a href="https://edinburghcyclehire.com/stations">Just Eat Cycles</a>
          stations at Summerhall (Meadows East, Melville Terrace) and Riego
          Street at junction with East Fountainbridge which should take you
          most of the distance. Requires the app and prior registration though.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please don't forget to bring your badge. (If you'd like to bring a +1
    please get in touch, we may be able to arrange that.)
  </p>
  <p>
    This will be a private event at least until 23.30, but there won't be a
    cloakroom where you can leave your jackets/bags and neither we nor the bar
    will take responsibility for any lost or damaged items, so you may want to
    drop off your gear at the hotel before you head there.

  <p>
  There is no official conference hotel, but we have prepared a small list of
  possible hotels for your convenience. If you are also attending ELCE which
  is at a different venue then other hotels may be better suited.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following is just a small selection of hotels which may or may not be
  suitable. Edinburgh is a major city and tourist destination and as such has
  many hotels and hostels in all price categories. The below is merely a small
  selection, you can find more using the usual booking engines such as
  booking.com, lastminute.com or airbnb.com. As always, it is advisable to book
  your accommodation earlier rather than later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The GStreamer conference venue (<a href="https://www.summerhall.co.uk/about/location/">Summerhall</a>)
  is located east of The Meadows near Edinburgh's historic city centre. It
  should be easy to reach by taxi or public transport from all directions.
  There are a number of smaller hotels, hostels, and bed and breakfast places
  in the area around the venue, but we won't list those here since they usually
  only have a very limited number of rooms available.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following hotels had at least a couple of rooms left at the time of
  writing, but there are many other hotels in the city which may be better
  located or provide better value:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-8484-ibis-edinburgh-centre-south-bridge-royal-mile/index.shtml">Ibis Edinburgh Centre South Bridge</a> - ca. 14 minutes walk to venue, 6 minutes by bus (every 3 mins)</li>
    <li><a href="https://thrumshotel.com/">The Thrums</a> - a bit south of the venue (so further from city centre), ca. 8 minute walk to venue, 5 mins by bus, 3 mins by taxi/uber</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.jurysinns.com/hotels/edinburgh/">Jurys Inn</a> - ca. 20 minutes walk to venue, 14 mins by bus, 6 mins by taxi/uber</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-2039-ibis-edinburgh-centre-royal-mile-hunter-square-new-rooms/index.shtml">Ibis Edinburgh Centre Royal Mile</a> - 15min walk to venue, 10 mins by bus, 6 mins by taxi/uber.</li>
    <li><a href="https://staycentral.co.uk/">Stay Central Hotel</a> - ca. 15 minute walk to venue, or 13 by bus, 6 mins by taxi/uber</li>
    <li><a href="https://cityroomz.com/">cityroomz Edinburgh</a> - ca. 30 minute walk or 20 mins by bus from venue, but close to EICC (for ELCE) and CodeBase (for the GStreamer hackfest)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/ediri-residence-inn-edinburgh/">Residence Inn by Marriott Edinburgh</a> - 4-star hotel, 10-minute walk to venue</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/205/Edinburgh-Central-hotel/">Travelodge</a> - 2-star hotel, "budget" lodging, ~15-minute walk to venue</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-3271-novotel-edinburgh-centre/index.shtml">Novotel Edinburgh City Centre</a> - between venue and EICC/CodeBase, ca. 15 minute walk to venue, 16 mins by bus, 6 mins by taxi/uber</li>
   <li><a href="https://www.leonardohotels.co.uk/hotels/edinburgh/edinburgh-royal">Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Haymarket</a> - close to EICC (for ELCE), 30mins walk to venue, 21 mins by bus, 9 mins by taxi/uber</li>
   <li><a href="https://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/hampton-by-hilton-edinburgh-west-end-EDIFBHX/index.html">Hampton by Hilton Edinburgh West End</a> - closer to EICC (for ELCE), 29 mins walk to GStreamer conf venue, 9 mins by taxi/uber.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  In general, any hotel in the Old Town area should be fine, or even New Town
  north of Waverley station. You may have to walk a bit though or take a taxi.
  Public transport connections should also be good and frequent from all parts
  of the city centre.
  </p>
  <p>
  For those attending ELCE, <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/attend/venue-travel/">hotel recommendations for ELCE can</a> also be found
  on the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/attend/venue-travel/">ELCE website</a>.
