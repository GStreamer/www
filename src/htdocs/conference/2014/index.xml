  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>
  The GStreamer Conference is a conference for developers, decision-makers,
  community members, industry partners, and anyone else interested in the
  GStreamer multimedia framework or Open Source and cross-platform multimedia.
  </p>

  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  <!-- The call for papers is now closed and talk proposals can no longer be submitted. -->
  <p>
  The call for papers is now open and talk proposals can be submitted.
  </p>
  <p>
  The deadline for talk proposals is Wednesday 23 July 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
  The initial submission needs to be only a couple of sentences or paragraphs
  describing the talk you want to give and the desired length of your talk
  (please allow for 5-10 minutes of questions at the end as well).
  </p>
  <p>
  Talks can be on almost anything multimedia related, ranging from talks about
  applications to challenges in the lower levels in the stack or hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
  Talk slots will be available in varying durations from 20 minutes up to an
  hour. We want to hear from you, what you are working on, what you are using
  GStreamer for, what difficulties you have encountered and how you solved them,
  what your plans are.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please send all proposals to <a href="mailto:gstreamer-conference@lists.freedesktop.org">gstreamer-conference@<!-- -->lists.freedesktop.org</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Showcase or Lightening Talks</h2>
  <p>
    If you don't think you have enough material for a full talk, but perhaps
    just want to showcase something you're working on, or present a problem or
    challenge you are facing or have solved, and that you think might be
    interesting for others to hear about, why not submit a 5-10 minute
    mini-talk for our <i>lightening talk</i>/<i>showcase</i> event?
  </p>
  <p>
    Simply send a quick mail to the e-mail address above to reserve your slot.
  </p>

  <h2>Schedule and speakers list</h2>
  <p>
    The conference schedule and speaker list will be available at a later date
    once the call for papers has closed.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be a social event for attendees on Thursday 16 October 2014
    in the evening (to be confirmed).
  </p>
  <!--
  <p>
    The <a href="schedule.html">conference schedule is now available</a>.
    We hope you will be as excited about this years
    schedule as we are. In addition to of course many in-depth GStreamer talks
    we also have presentations on some of the most important core Linux
    multimedia technologies like ALSA, Mesa, Wayland, the Opus Codec and V4L.
    We have managed to get some of the leading developers from the world of
    open source multimedia come to speak this year, so this is definetly an
    event you should not be missing out on.
  </p>

  <h2>Who should join?</h2>
  <p>
    Anyone interested in open source cross-platform multimedia is encouraged
    to join us at the GStreamer Conference 2014.
    Whether you are a hobbyist or a student interested in the field of
    multimedia, or working for a company using or looking to use GStreamer
    in their products, this is the perfect event for you to network at and
    to learn more about the latest technological breakthroughs in and around
    GStreamer. The talks will target both developers and managers.
  </p>

  <h2>Registration</h2>
  <p>
  Registration is now open and will stay open until the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b><a href="http://www.regonline.com/gstreamerconference2014">Sign up for the GStreamer Conference here</a></b>
  </p>
  <p>
  There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
    <table width="60%" cellpadding="5">
      <tr><td>Professional</td><td>250 USD (until 31 July)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Professional</td><td>350 USD (from 1 August)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Student/hobbyist</td><td>100 USD</td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    The registration fee includes continental breakfast and lunch at the venue
    on both conference days.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
    the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you
    are a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
    If in doubt drop us a mail or just register as hobbyist. The important
    thing is that you'll make it to the conference!
  </p>
  <p>
    Speakers who do a longer presentation will receive a discount code, so if
    you have submitted a talk or plan to submit a talk you may want to wait
    with registration until a decision has been made as to whether your
    proposal has been accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sponsors will receive a number of free registrations as part of the
    <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/2014/gstreamer-sponsor.pdf">sponsorship package</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Co-hosted conferences</h2>
  <p>
    There are a few other events taking place alongside or just before the
    GStreamer Conference on October 16-17 this year, so if you are making
    your way to Düsseldorf you might want to consider combining the GStreamer
    Conference with some of the other events.
