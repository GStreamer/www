  </p>
  <p>
  Please allow at least 5 minutes for questions at the end as well.

    <li>30 minutes</li>
    <li>40 minutes</li>

  including questions.
  </p>

  <p>
  We want to hear from you, what you are working on, what you are using

  what your plans are, what you like, what you dislike, how to improve things!
  </p>
  <p>
  Please submit all proposals through the <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/9/">GStreamer Conference 2024 Talk Submission Portal</a>.
  </p>

  Lightning talks may still be proposed, see below for more details.
  </p>
-->

  <h2>Showcase or Lightning Talks</h2>
  <p>
    There will again be opportunities for short lightning talks for those who
    do not wish to present a full talk, but just want to showcase something
    they're working on, or present a problem or challenge they are facing or
    have solved, and that they think might be interesting for others to hear
    about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Want to submit a ca. 5-minute mini-talk for our <i>lightning talk</i>/<i>showcase</i> event?
  </p>
  <p>
    Please submit all lightning talks through the <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/9/">GStreamer Conference 2024 Talk Submission Portal</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can log in using your existing freedesktop.org GitLab account if you have one, or register a new account with the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no deadline for Lightning Talk submissions, slots will be
    allocated on a first-come first-serve basis.
  </p>

  <h2>Registration</h2>
  
  <p>Registration will be opening really soon, stay tuned! (Updated: 28 August 2024)</p>

  <p>
  There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
    <table width="80%" cellpadding="5">
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Regular)</b></td><td><b>375 CAD</b> (ca. 250 EUR / 280 USD) <b>+ ca. 15% taxes</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Supporter)</b></td><td><b>750 CAD</b> (ca. 500 EUR / 560 USD) <b>+ ca. 15% taxes</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Speakers (for non-lightning talks)</b></td><td><b>Free</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Student/Hobbyist</b></td><td><b>Free or voluntary donation</b></td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
  </p>
<!--
  <p>
    All tickets include lunch at the venue on both conference days
    as well as access to the social event on Monday evening.
  </p>
-->
  <p>
    For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
    the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you
    are a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
    If in doubt drop us a mail or just register as hobbyist. The important
    thing is that you'll make it to the conference!

<!--
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usual timetables</strong>. Lunch time: 13:00 - 15:30. Dinner
    time: 20:30 - 22:30. Note that you won't be able to find a restaurant open
    for lunch at 12:00 or for dinner at 18:00, neither at 19:00; thus you might
    want to start your day a bit "later" than usual. Main reason behind this is
    that A Coruña is in the same timezone as central Europe, and <a
    href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/spain/la-coruna">sunrise and sunset
    times</a> are somehow shifted with regard to common standards in other parts
    of the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Language</strong>. The official languages in A Coruña are
    Galician and Spanish. Not everybody is able to understand or speak English
    (in the bus, taxi, hotel, etc). The GStreamer Conference is run in
    English.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate</strong>. A Coruña has a climate heavily moderated by
    the Atlantic Ocean. Average temperatures are around 10ºC (51ºF) in winter
    and 19ºC (66ºF) during summer. (See more info at <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru%C3%B1a#Climate">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Tourism</strong>. <a

  </ul>

  <h2>Code of Conduct and Anti-Harrassment Policy</h2>
  <h3>Policy</h3>
  <p>
  The GStreamer project and the conference organisers are dedicated to
  providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.
  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
  </p>
  <p>
  Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments,
  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
  events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
  immediately. We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference
  venues, hackfest venues, and conference-related social events.
  </p>
  <p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers
  and/or their delegates may take any action they deem appropriate, including
  warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. If you are being
  harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
  concerns, please contact a conference organiser or member of the
  code of conduct committee below immediately.
  </p>
  <h3>Reporting Breaches</h3>
  <p>
  Breaches of the code of conduct should be reported either by e-mail via
  <a href="mailto:code-of-conduct@gstreamer.org">code-of-conduct@gstreamer.org</a>,
  or by contacting one of the following people:

  </p>
  <p>
  See <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgFoundation/Policies/HarassmentDetails/">here</a>
  for implementation details and guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
  This anti-harassment policy is based on the
  <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/4/page/26-code-of-conduct">XDC 2024 code of conduct</a>
  which in turn is based on the example policy from the
  <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism wiki</a>,
