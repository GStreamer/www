<h1>GStreamer Conference 2010</h1>
<h2>Cambridge, United Kingdom, 26th of October 2010</h2>
<p>
In conjuction with the <a href="http://www.embeddedlinuxconference.com/elc_europe10/">
CE Linux Conference Europe</a> we are happy to host and arrange the first full day conference
focusing on GStreamer and related technologies. Speakers from a wide range of companies and 
fields will attend to speak about available GStreamer technologies and future developments.
</p>
<p>
The conference will be held in the ballroom at the <a href="http://www.universityarms.info/">
University Arms Hotel</a> the day before the CE Linux Europe conference, making it ideal to combine 
the two events.

The talks hosted will cover a range of technologies built around GStreamer aimed at embedded,
desktop and server usage. There will also be a presentation on the plans for the GStreamer 1.0 release.
