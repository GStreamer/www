    are a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
    If in doubt drop us a mail or just register as hobbyist. The important
    thing is that you'll make it to the conference!

  <h2>Code of Conduct and Anti-Harrassment Policy</h2>
  <h3>Policy</h3>
  <p>
  The GStreamer project and the conference organisers are dedicated to
  providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.
  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
  </p>
  <p>
  Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments,
  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
  events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
  immediately. We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference
  venues, hackfest venues, and conference-related social events.
  </p>
  <p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers
  and/or their delegates may take any action they deem appropriate, including
  warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. If you are being
  harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
  concerns, please contact a conference organiser or member of the
  code of conduct committee below immediately.
  </p>
  <h3>Reporting Breaches</h3>
  <p>
  Breaches of the code of conduct should be reported either by e-mail via
  <a href="mailto:code-of-conduct@gstreamer.org">code-of-conduct@gstreamer.org</a>.
