  The <b>9<sup><small>th</small></sup> GStreamer Conference</b> will take place
  on Thursday and Friday <b>25-26 October 2018</b> at Summerhall in
  <b>Edinburgh, Scotland, UK</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is just after the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/">Embedded Linux Conference Europe (ELCE)</a>,
  but not officially co-hosted with it and at a different venue in Edinburgh.
  </p>

  <p>
  Talks will be recorded again by <a href="https://www.ubicast.eu/">Ubicast</a>.<!-- and
  are available at <a href="https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/channels/#gstreamer-conference-2016">GStreamer Conference 2016 videos</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  Slides for some of the talks and the lightning talks can be found in the
  <a href="&site;/data/events/gstreamer-conference/2016/">GStreamer Conference 2016 slides</a>
  folder.

  <h2>Schedule</h2>
  <p>
  <a href="schedule.html">Click here for the conference schedule</a>.
  </p>
-->
  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>
  The GStreamer Conference is a conference for developers, decision-makers,
  community members, industry partners, students and anyone else interested in
  the GStreamer multimedia framework or Open Source and cross-platform multimedia.
  </p>

  <h2>Registration</h2>
  <p>
  Registration is now open and will stay open until the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b><a href="https://ti.to/gstreamer/gstreamer-conference-2018">Sign up for the GStreamer Conference here</a></b>
  </p>
  <p>
  There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
    <table width="80%" cellpadding="5">
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Early Bird)</b></td><td><b>200 EUR</b> (ca. 235 USD, 175 GBP) (early bird, limited and available only until 18 Sept)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Regular)</b></td><td><b>300 EUR</b> (ca. 350 USD, 265 GBP) (regular)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Supporter)</b></td><td><b>300+N EUR</b> (donation)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Student/Hobbyist/Community</b></td><td><b>Voluntary donation</b></td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    All tickets include lunch at the venue on both conference days
    as well as access to the social event on Thursday evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
    the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you
    are a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
    If in doubt drop us a mail or just register as hobbyist. The important
    thing is that you'll make it to the conference!
  </p>

  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  <p>
  The call for papers is now open and talk proposals can be submitted.
  </p>
  <p>
  Talks will be accepted and announced in batches subject to slot availability,
  so we recommend you send your proposal as early as possible!
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>The preliminary deadline for talk proposals is 31 August 2018.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  The initial submission needs to be only a couple of sentences or paragraphs
  describing the talk you want to give and the desired length of your talk
  (please allow at least 5 minutes for questions at the end as well).
  </p>
  <p>
  Talks can be on almost anything multimedia related, ranging from talks about
  applications to challenges in the lower levels in the stack or hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
  Talk slots will have one of the following durations: 20 minutes, 30 minutes,
  or 45 minutes, including questions. We will only have a small number of
  45-minute slots available, so please consider whether you could also make do
  with 30 minutes before asking for a 45-minute slot, or let us know if both
  are an option.
  </p>
  <p>
  We want to hear from you, what you are working on, what you are using
  GStreamer for, what difficulties you have encountered and how you solved them,
  what your plans are, what you like, what you dislike, how to improve things!
  </p>
  <p>
  Please send all proposals to <a href="mailto:gstreamer-conference@lists.freedesktop.org">gstreamer-conference<!-- --><i>&#64;</i><!-- -->lists.freedesktop.org</a>.
  You do not need to subscribe to the list, and you should receive a confirmation that your proposal has been received within a couple of days.
  </p>

  <h2>Showcase or Lightning Talks</h2>
  <p>
    There will again be opportunities for short lightning talks for those who
    do not wish to present a full talk, but just want to showcase something
    they're working on, or present a problem or challenge they are facing or
    have solved, and that they think might be interesting for others to hear
    about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Want to submit a ca. 5-minute mini-talk for our <i>lightning talk</i>/<i>showcase</i> event?
  </p>
  <p>
    Simply send a quick mail to <a href="mailto:gstreamer-conference@lists.freedesktop.org">gstreamer-conference<!-- --><i>&#64;</i><!-- -->lists.freedesktop.org</a> above to reserve your slot (subject to availability).  </p>
  <p>
    There is no deadline for Lightning Talk submissions, slots will be
    allocated on a first-come first-serve basis.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Events</h2>
  <p>
    There will be a social event for registered attendees on Thursday evening.
  </p>

<!--
  <h3>Friday: Welcome drinks, food and pre-registration at the Prague Beer Museum</h3>
  <p>
    Join us for some drinks and food at the <a href="https://www.praguebeermuseum.cz/en/"><b>Prague Beer Museum</b></a>
    (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rSdx5pmhGd72">Smetanovo Nabrezi location</a>, near the Charles Bridge / Karlův most)! This is
    a cash-only pub, so credit cards are not accepted (they seem to accept cash in CZK, EUR and USD though). Food and drinks will be
    available for purchase. (<a href="https://www.praguebeermuseum.cz/en/content?page=submenu&amp;XUBPAGEHL=2&amp;XUBPAGE=99">Food menu</a>,
    <a href="https://www.praguebeermuseum.cz/en/content?page=submenu&amp;XUBPAGEHL=2&amp;XUBPAGE=98">Drinks menu</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to achieve a minimum spend, so if there's anything on the food menu
    that appeals to you, we'd be grateful if you decided to have dinner there
    as well. Please order at the table (not at the bar), so that all spending
    is counted towards us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have room reserved upstairs (technically from 8pm, but should be okay to show up a bit earlier). There will be service at the tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting there: From Node5, it's a 35-minute walk (2.9km), 9-minute taxi
    ride, or 20-25 minutes by public transport (including walking). Either
    walk to Andel and catch a tram or B-line metro from there, or catch tram 15
    from <i>Na Knížecí</i> which is just around the corner from Node5 and head
    north to stop <i>Malostranské náměstí</i> and stroll across the Charles
    Bridge.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Saturday: Food and drinks at La Loca Music Bar and Lounge</h3>
  <p>
    Our main social event will be on Saturday at <a href="https://www.laloca.cz/en/home"><b>La Loca Music Bar and Lounge</b></a>
    from ca. 19.30 until late. Food and drinks will be provided (thanks to our sponsors!),
    including vegetarian options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Get there by public transport:
    The easiest way to get there from Node5 is to jump onto Tram 5 at stop
    <i>Na Knížecí</i> which is just around the corner from Node5, and go
    4 stops to <i>Myslíkova</i>. La Loca Music Bar is just around the corner
    from there (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Uc12udep93C2">Odborů 278/4, Prague 2</a>).
    It should be in the same building as "Mosaic House".
  </p>
  <p>
    There will also be a cloakroom where you can leave your jackets/bags
    (although neither we nor the bar will take responsibility for any lost or
    damaged items of course).
  </p>
  <p>
    Please don't forget to bring your badge.

  <h2>Hotels</h2>
  <p>
  There is no official conference hotel. <!-- but we have prepared a small list of
  hotels for your convenience.-->
  We will provide a list of hotel suggestions at a later date.
  </p>
<!--
  <p>
  For those who are planning to also attend the Embedded Linux Conference Europe,
  the Hilton Prague where ELCE takes place is within 20 minutes door-to-door
  from the GStreamer Conference venue Node5 (7 minutes by metro using line B
  from Florenc to Anděl).
  </p>
  <p>
  The following is just a small selection of hotels which may or may not be
  suitable. Prague is a major city and tourist destination and as such has
  many hotels and hostels in all price categories. The below is merely a small
  selection, you can find more using the usual booking engines such as
  booking.com, lastminute.com or airbnb.com. As always, it is advisable to book
  your accommodation earlier rather than later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The conference venue (<a href="https://node5.cz/">Node5</a>) is in the
  district <i>Praha 5</i> not far from the transport hub and B line metro stop
  <i>Anděl</i>. It should therefore be fairly easy reach by public transport or
  taxi from all areas of the city and especially the city centre.
  There is public transport in form of busses, trams and an underground metro.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following hotels are located near the venue (Node5) and the Anděl
  transport hub, and had at least a couple of rooms left at the time of
  writing, but there are many other hotels in the city which may be better
