  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>
  The GStreamer Conference is a conference for developers, community members,
  decision-makers, industry partners, researchers, students and anyone else
  interested in the GStreamer multimedia framework or Open Source and
  cross-platform multimedia.
  </p>

  <h2>Who should attend?</h2>
  <p>
    Anyone interested in open source cross-platform multimedia is encouraged
    to join us at the GStreamer Conference 2023!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are a hobbyist, app developer, researcher or student interested
    in the field of multimedia, or working for a company that is using or looking
    to use GStreamer in their products, this is the perfect event for you to network
    at and to learn more about the latest technological developments and project news,
    and to meet developers as well as the wider community.
  </p>


  <h2>Registration</h2>
  <p>
  Registration is expected to open in late June or early July. <!-- FIXME --> Please stay tuned for updates.
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
  <b><a href="FIXME">Sign up for the GStreamer Conference here</a></b>
  </p>
  -->

  <p>
  There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
    <table width="80%" cellpadding="5">
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Early Bird)</b></td><td><b>250 EUR</b> (ca. 280 USD)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Regular)</b></td><td><b>350 EUR</b> (ca. 390 USD)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Professional (Supporter)</b></td><td><b>500 EUR (ca. 555 USD)</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Student/Hobbyist</b></td><td><b>Free or voluntary donation</b></td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    All tickets include lunch at the venue on both conference days
    as well as access to the social event on Monday evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
    the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you
    are a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
    If in doubt drop us a mail or just register as hobbyist. The important
    thing is that you'll make it to the conference!

  <h2>Showcase or Lightning Talks</h2>
  <p>
    There will again be opportunities for short lightning talks for those who
    do not wish to present a full talk, but just want to showcase something
    they're working on, or present a problem or challenge they are facing or
    have solved, and that they think might be interesting for others to hear
    about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lightning talk proposals can be submitted once the Call for Papers opens,
    up to the day of the conference.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Events</h2>

  <h3>Sunday: Welcome drinks and/or food (venue to be determined)</h3>
  <p>
    Join us for some drinks and/or food at <i>tbd</i>. Details to be confirmed
    at a later time.
  </p>
<!--
  <p>
    Food and drinks will be available for purchase, credit cards should be accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a semi-private section reserved for us upstairs on the right ("The Garage").
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
-->

  <h3>Monday: Social Event with Food and Drinks (venue to be determined)</h3>
  <p>
    We plan on having a social event again on the first day of the conference.
    Details to be confirmed at a later time.
  </p>
<!--
  <h3>Thursday: Social Event with Food and Drinks at Ninkasi Saint-Paul</h3>
  <p>
    Our main social event will be on Thursday at <a href="https://www.ninkasi.fr/lieux/ninkasi-saint-paul/"><b>Ninkasi Saint-Paul</b></a>
    from ca. 19.00-19.30 until late. Food and drinks will be provided (thanks to our sponsors!),
    including some vegetarian/vegan options.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ninkasi Saint Paul is located on <i>5 Rue Octavio Mey</i> at the northern end
  of Lyon's historic Old Town district.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that there are multiple Ninkasi in Lyon, we'll be at the Saint Paul one.
  </p>
  <p>
    How to get there from L'Embarcadère:
    <ul>
      <li>on foot: should be a nice walk, 30-35 minutes</li>
      <li>by public transport: best to check Google Maps. Metro from Perrache to Hôtel de Ville - Louis Pradel (4 stops north) might save you some walking.</li>
      <li>by Lime scooter: faster than on foot, probably!</li>
      <li>by taxi/uber: should be a ca. 10 minute ride depending on traffic, perhaps 7-15 EUR or so</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please don't forget to bring your badge. (If you'd like to bring a +1
    please get in touch, we may be able to arrange that.)
  </p>
  <p>
    We will have two private areas at the venue - upstairs and downstairs, but
    part of the venue around the bar will be open to the public. There won't be
    a cloakroom where you can leave your jackets/bags and neither we nor the bar
    will take responsibility for any lost or damaged items, so you may want to
    drop off your gear at the hotel before you head there.
  </p>

  <h2>GStreamer hackfest</h2>
  <p>
    There will be a hackfest just after the conference, on Wednesday and Thursday
    27-28 September 2023, and perhaps a half day on Friday as well (tbd).
    The hackfest venue will be announced at a later time.
  </p>
  <!--
  <p>
    Please add yourself to the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/GstAutumnHackfest2019">wiki page</a>
    if you plan on attending the hackfest, so we have a rough idea of the number of
    people to expect. Mail Tim or Sebastian or pop onto the #gstreamer IRC channel if you
    don't have editing permissions for the wiki.
  </p>
  -->
  <p>
    GStreamer hackfests are fairly informal affairs, people mostly just sit
    around, drink coffee, discuss things, ask questions, and hack on whatever
    they feel like. Everyone with an interest in GStreamer is welcome to attend
    the hackfest.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usual timetables</strong>. Lunch time: 13:00 - 15:30. Dinner
    time: 20:30 - 22:30. Note that you won't be able to find a restaurant open
    for lunch at 12:00 or for dinner at 18:00, neither at 19:00; thus you might
    want to start your day a bit "later" than usual. Main reason behind this is
    that A Coruña is in the same timezone as central Europe, and <a
    href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/spain/la-coruna">sunrise and sunset
    times</a> are somehow shifted with regard to common standards in other parts
    of the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Language</strong>. The official languages in A Coruña are
    Galician and Spanish. Not everybody is able to understand or speak English
    (in the bus, taxi, hotel, etc). The GStreamer Conference is run in
    English.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate</strong>. A Coruña has a climate heavily moderated by
    the Atlantic Ocean. Average temperatures are around 10ºC (51ºF) in winter
    and 19ºC (66ºF) during summer. (See more info at <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru%C3%B1a#Climate">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Tourism</strong>. <a
