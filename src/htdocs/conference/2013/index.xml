<h2>Schedule and speakers list</h2>
<p>The <a href="gstreamer-conference-timetable.html">full conference schedule is now available</a>. We hope you will be as excited about this years schedule as we are. In addition to of course many in-depth GStreamer talks we also have presentations on some of the most important core Linux multimedia technologies like ALSA, Mesa, Wayland, the Opus Codec and V4L. We have managed to get some of the leading developers from the world of open source multimedia come to speak this year, so this is definetly an event you should not be missing out on.
</p>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<p>
The call for papers is now open and talk proposals can be submitted.
</p>
<p>
The deadline for talk proposals is Thursday 25 July 2013.
</p>
<p>
The initial submission needs to be only a couple of paragraphs describing the
talk you want to give and the desired length of your talk (please allow for
5-10 minutes of questions at the end as well).
</p>
<p>
Talks can be on almost anything multimedia related, ranging from talks about
applications to challenges in the lower levels in the stack or hardware.
</p>
<p>
Please send all proposals to <a href="mailto:gstreamer-conference@lists.freedesktop.org">gstreamer-conference@<!-- -->lists.freedesktop.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>Who should join?</h2>
<p>
Anyone interested in open source multimedia is encouraged to join us at the GStreamer Conference 2013.
Whether you are a hobbyist or a student interested in the field of multimedia, or working for a company
using or looking to use GStreamer in their products, this is the perfect event for you to network
at and to learn more about the latest technological breakthroughs in and around GStreamer. The talks
will target both developers and managers alike.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
Registration is now open: <b><a href="http://www.regonline.com/gstreamerconference2013">sign up for the GStreamer Conference</a></b>
</p>
<p>
There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
</p>
<p>
<div style="margin-left:5%">
<table width="30%" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>Professional</td><td>250 USD (until 31 July)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Professional</td><td>350 USD (from 1 August)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Student/hobbyist</td><td>100 USD</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>
<p>
For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you are
a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
</p>
<p>
Speakers will receive a discount code, so if you have submitted a talk or plan
to submit a talk you may want to wait with registration until a decision has
been made as to whether your proposal has been accepted.
</p>
<p>
Sponsors will receive a number of free registrations as part of the
sponsorship package.
</p>

<h2>Co-hosted conferences</h2>
<p>
There are four other events taking place alongside and after the GStreamer Conference this year, so if you are making your way to Edinburgh you might want to consider combining the GStreamer Conference with some of the other events.
