</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/2013/schedule.html">conference schedule</a> and is now available.
</p>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<p>
The call for papers is now closed and talk proposals can no longer be submitted.
</p>

<h2>Who should join?</h2>
<p>
Anyone interested in open source multimedia is encouraged to join us at the GStreamer Conference 2013.
Whether you are a hobbyist or a student interested in the field of multimedia, or working for a company
using or looking to use GStreamer in their products, this is the perfect event for you to network
at and to learn more about the latest technological breakthroughs in and around GStreamer. The talks
will target both developers and managers alike.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
Registration is now open: <b><a href="http://www.regonline.com/gstreamerconference2013">sign up for the GStreamer Conference</a></b>
</p>
<p>
There will be separate registration options for both professionals and for students and hobbyists:
</p>
<p>
<div style="margin-left:5%">
<table width="30%" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>Professional</td><td>250 USD (until 31 July)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Professional</td><td>350 USD (from 1 August)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Student/hobbyist</td><td>100 USD</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>
<p>
For those uncertain about whether to register as a professional or hobbyist,
the general rule is that if your company pays for you or sponsors you, you are
a professional, and if you personally pay you are a student or hobbyist.
</p>
<p>
Speakers will receive a discount code, so if you have submitted a talk or plan
to submit a talk you may want to wait with registration until a decision has
been made as to whether your proposal has been accepted.
</p>
<p>
Sponsors will receive a number of free registrations as part of the
<a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/2013/gstreamer-sponsor.pdf">sponsorship package</a>.
</p>
