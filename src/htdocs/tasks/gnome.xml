  <task name="propdocs">
      <title>Create online docs for Profile manager</title>
      <description>
  	There is a new tool for setting values for audio encoding bitrates as such called gnome-audio-profiles-properties. This tools is meant to be called from relevant applications. But it needs to have its own online docs added</description>
  
      <why>
  	All GNOME applications should have online documentation and this being a poweruser feature definetly needs it.
      </why>
  
      <how>
  	Look at gnome-sound-recorder or any other GNOME module with online docs to see how they are done. You should also look over the GNOME Documentation project for information on how to do this.</how>

      <difficulty>
        EASY - Many examples to look at.

        Patch should be made against gnome-media CVS and sent it ot the gnome-multimedia mailing list.

    <task name="libgnomeify">
      <title>Update and merge libgnome GStreamer patches</title>
      <description>
  	There where a couple of patches made long ago that migrates libgnome to use GStreamer for audio playback. These patches should be cleaned up (use GStreamer directly) and verified to work with GStreamer 0.7/0.8.
  	</description>
  
      <why>
  	As we are now moving to really take advantage of GStreamer in the GNOME technology stack it is natural to also move libgnome to GStreamer.</why>
  
      <how>
  	Patches can be found in these two GNOME bugzilla entries <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82340">82340</A> and <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82341">82341</A>. These patches uses monkey-media. Today we probably want to access GStreamer directly or use gstplay.</how>

      <difficulty>
        MEDIUM - Fairly simple code, but at a very high impact place in the toolchain.

        Patch should be made against libgnome and libgnomeui CVS and sent to the gnome-desktop mailing list.

   <task name="mediacaching">
      <title>Design and implement media info caching</title>
      <description>
  	We want a system similar to the image thumbnail standard on freedesktop.org for caching metadata. That way every application do not need to cache this for themselves.
  	</description>
  
      <why>
  	That way every application do not need to cache this for themselves.</why>
  
      <how>
  	Look at the <A HREF="http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html">thumbnail standard</A> for some design ideas.</how>
  
      <difficulty>
        HARD - Needs good design and implementation skills, along with patience with working with large groups of people.
      </difficulty>
      <submit>
        Proposal should be sent to freedesktop. Implementation patches to relevant modules.
