      <title>Create online docs for Profile manager</title>
      <description>
  	There is a new tool for setting values for audio encoding bitrates as such called gnome-audio-profiles-properties. This tools is meant to be called from relevant applications. But it needs to have its own online docs added</description>
  
      <why>
  	All GNOME applications should have online documentation and this being a poweruser feature definetly needs it.
      </why>
  
      <how>
  	Look at gnome-sound-recorder or any other GNOME module with online docs to see how they are done. You should also look over the GNOME Documentation project for information on how to do this.</how>

        EASY - Many examples to look at.

      <title>Port libgnome to use GStreamer instead of esound</title>
      <description>
One of the last parts of GNOME still depending on esound directly is libgnome, which use it to provide a simple API for doing system sounds. This API should be ported to use GStreamer for its backend.
  	</description>
  
      <why>
Switching to GStreamer will allow GNOME to drop esound at some point in the future. It also allows distributors to choose not to ship or use esound with their systems and instead output directly to for instance alsa/dmix
      </why>
  
      <how>
There is a couple of issues that needs to be taken into account. One thing esound provides is caching of sound samples, which is especially usefull in a networked setup. Adding some API/system to GStreamer to abstract away this capability would be a good idea when doing this task. Next question then is what to do when users use output plugins which do not do this type of caching. Probably just fallback to a non-caching mode. There are some old patches that can be found in these two GNOME bugzilla entries <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82340">82340</A> and <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82341">82341</A>.

        MEDIUM - Fairly simple code, but at a very high impact place in the toolchain.

        Patch should be made against libgnome and libgnomeui CVS and sent to the gnome-desktop mailing list.

   <task name="mediacaching">
      <title>Design and implement media info caching</title>
      <description>
  	We want a system similar to the image thumbnail standard on freedesktop.org for caching metadata. That way every application do not need to cache this for themselves.

      <why>
  	That way every application do not need to cache this for themselves.</why>
  
      <how>
  	Look at the <A HREF="http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html">thumbnail standard</A> for some design ideas.</how>
  
      <difficulty>
        HARD - Needs good design and implementation skills, along with patience with working with large groups of people.
      </difficulty>
      <submit>
        Proposal should be sent to freedesktop. Implementation patches to relevant modules.
