  <title>GStreamer: Tasks</title>
  <body>
In the spirit of the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/bounties">GNOME bounties</a>,
but with a lot less money in the bank, we decided to create a list of tasks.
If you're a developer who wants to get started using GStreamer and needs
a well-defined task to take on, look no further.  All of these tasks have
enough comments and links to ease you into a small part of the codebase.
<br/>
If you would like to work on integration between GNOME and GStreamer, check our
<a href="gnome.html">GNOME tasklist</a>.  If you just want to work on
GStreamer, check our <a href="gstreamer.html">GStreamer tasklist</a>.
